<h2 class="nobreak">M. MAETERLINCK&#8217;S INTRODUCTION<br />
TO HIS TRANSLATION<br />
OF &#8220;THE ADORNMENT OF THE<br />
SPIRITUAL MARRIAGE.&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> works are more correctly beautiful
than this book of Ruysbroeck L&#8217;Admirable.
Many mystics&mdash;Swedenborg and Novalis
among others&mdash;are more potent in their
influence, and more timely. It is very
probable that his writings may but rarely
meet the needs of to-day. Looking at
him from another point of view, I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
few more clumsy authors. He wanders off
now and then into strange puerilities, and
the first twenty chapters of <i>The Adornment
of the Spiritual Marriage</i>, although they
are perhaps a necessary preparation for
what follows, contain little more than mild
and pious commonplaces. Outwardly, at
least, he has no order, no logic of the schools.
He is full of repetitions, and sometimes
seems to contradict himself. He shows
the ignorance of a child along with the
wisdom of one who might have returned
from the dead. Over his involved syntax
I have toiled more than once in the
sweat of my brow. He introduces an
image, and forgets it. There are some of
his images which the mind cannot realise,
and this phenomenon, so unusual in an
honest work, can only be explained by
his awkwardness or his extraordinary haste.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
He knows few of the tricks of language, and
can speak only of the unspeakable. He is
almost entirely ignorant of the habits,
skilled methods, and resources of philosophic
thought, and he is constrained to think only of
the unthinkable. When he speaks of his little
monastic garden, he can hardly tell us enough
about what goes on there; on that subject he
writes like a child. He undertakes to teach
us what transpires in the nature of God, and
writes pages which Plato could not have
written. Everywhere we find a grotesque
disproportion between his knowledge and
ignorance, his capacity and desire. You
must not expect a literary work; you will
see only the convulsive flight of an eagle,
dizzy, blind, and wounded, over snowy peaks.
I will add one word more by way of friendly
warning. It has been my lot to read books
generally considered most abstruse: <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Disciples at Sa&iuml;s</i>, and the <i>Fragments</i> of
Novalis, for instance; the <i>Biographia Literaria</i>
and the <i>Friend</i> of Samuel Taylor Coleridge;
the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato; the <i>Enneads</i> of
Plotinus; the <i>Divine Names</i> of St. Denys the
Areopagite; the <i>Aurora</i> of the great German
mystic, Jacob B&ouml;hme, with whom our author
has more than one point of analogy. I do
not venture to say that the works of Ruysbroeck
are more abstruse than these works;
but their abstruseness is less readily pardoned,
because we have here to do with an unknown
writer in whom we have no previous confidence.
I thought it necessary to give an
honest warning to idlers on the threshold of
this temple without architecture; for this
translation was undertaken only to please a
few Platonists. I believe that those who have
not lived in close fellowship with Plato and
with the Neo-Platonists of Alexandria will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
not proceed far in reading it. They will
think they are entering the void; they will
feel as if they were falling steadily into a
bottomless abyss, between black and slippery
rocks. In this book there is no common
light or air; as a spiritual abode it
will be insupportable to those who come
unprepared. Do not enter here from literary
curiosity; there are hardly any dainty nick-nacks,
and the botanist in search of fine
images will find as few flowers here as on the
polar ice-banks. I tell them that this is a
boundless desert, where they will die of thirst.
They will find here very few phrases which
one may handle and admire after the way of
literary critics; nothing but jets of flame or
blocks of ice. Do not seek for roses in Iceland.
Some flower may still linger between
two icebergs&mdash;and indeed there are strange
outbursts, unknown expressions, unheard-of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
analogies, but they will not repay you for
the time lost in coming so far to pluck them.
Before entering here one must be in a philosophic
state as different from our ordinary
condition as the state of waking is from that
of slumber. Porphyry, in his <i>Principles of
the Theory of Intelligibles</i>, seems to me to
have written a warning which might fitly
stand at the beginning of this book&mdash;&#8220;By
our intelligence we say many things of the
principle which is higher than the intelligence.
But these things are divined much better by
an absence of thought than by thought. It
is the same with this idea as with that of
sleep, of which we speak up to a certain point
in our waking state, but the knowledge and
perception of which we can gain only by
sleeping. Like is known only by like, and
the condition of all knowledge is that the
subject should become like to the object.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>It is most difficult, I repeat, to understand
such things without preparation; and
I believe that, in spite of our preparatory
studies, a great deal of this mysticism will
seem to us purely theoretic, and that the
most of these experiences of supernatural
psychology will be accessible to us only
in the character of spectators. The philosophical
imagination is a faculty which is
educated very slowly. We are here, all at
once, on the confines of human thought, and
far within the polar circle of the mind. It
is strangely cold here; it is strangely dark;
and yet all around there is light and flame.
But to those who come without having
trained their mind to these new perceptions,
this light and these flames are as dark
and cold as painted images. We are dealing
here with the most exact of sciences. We
have to explore the most rugged and least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
habitable promontories of the divine &#8220;Know
Thyself&#8221;; and the midnight sun hangs over
the tempestuous sea, where the psychology
of man mingles with the psychology of God.
We have constantly to keep in mind that
we are dealing here with a very profound
science, and not with a dream. Dreams are
not unanimous; dreams have no roots;
while the glowing flower of divine metaphysic,
which is here full blown, has its
mysterious roots in Persia and in India, in
Egypt and in Greece. And yet it seems
unconscious as a flower, and knows nothing
of its roots. Unhappily it is almost impossible
for us to put ourselves in the position
of the soul which, without effort, conceived
this science; we cannot perceive it <i>ab intra</i>
and reproduce it in ourselves. We lack that
which Emerson would call the same &#8220;central
spontaneity&#8221;; we can no longer transform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
these ideas into our own substance; the
utmost we can do is to take count, from the
outside, of the tremendous experiences which
are within the reach of only a very few
souls during the whole existence of a
planetary system. &#8220;It is not lawful,&#8221; says
Plotinus, &#8220;to inquire into the origin of
this intuitive science as if it were a thing
dependent on place and movement; for it
does not approach from here, nor set out
from there, in order to go elsewhere, but it
appears or does not appear. So that we
must not pursue it in order to discover its
secret sources, but wait in silence until it
suddenly shines out upon us, preparing ourselves
for the sacred sight, as the eye waits
patiently for the rising of the sun.&#8221; And
elsewhere he adds: &#8220;It is not by imagination
nor by reason, which is itself obliged
to draw its principles from elsewhere, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
we represent to ourselves intelligible things
(that is to say, the highest of all), but rather
it is by our faculty for beholding them, the
faculty which enables us to speak of them
here below. We see them therefore by
awaking in ourselves, here on earth, the
same powers which we shall have to awake
when we are in the world of pure intelligence.
We are like a man who, on reaching the
summit of a rock, perceives with his eyes
objects which are invisible to those who
have not made the ascent along with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But although all beings, from the stone
and the plant up to man, are contemplations,
they are unconscious contemplations; and it
is very difficult to rediscover in ourselves
some memory of the previous activity of the
dead faculty. In this respect we resemble
the eye in the Neo-Platonic image. &#8220;It
turns away from the light to see the darkness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
and by the very action it ceases to see;
for it cannot see the darkness with the light,
and yet without it, it sees not at all; and so,
by not seeing, it sees the darkness as far as
it is capable of seeing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know the judgment which most men
will pronounce on this book. They will
think it the work of a deluded monk, of a
pale solitary, a hermit, dizzy with fasting
and worn with fever. They will take it for
a wild, dark dream, crossed with vivid
lightning flashes,&mdash;nothing more. This is
the common idea which people form of the
mystics; and they forget too often that
they alone are the possessors of certainty.
If it be true, as has been said, that every
man is a Shakespeare in his dreams, we
might well ask whether every man is not
in this life an inarticulate mystic, a thousand
times more transcendental than those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
have confined themselves within the bonds
of words. Is not the eye of the lover or
of the mother, for instance, a thousand
times more abstruse, more impenetrable, and
more mystical than this book, which is
poor and easily explained, after all, like all
books, for these are but dead mysteries,
whose horizon will never be rekindled? If
we do not understand this, perhaps the
reason is that we no longer understand
anything. But, to return to our author, a
few will recognise without difficulty that, far
from being half-maddened by hunger, solitude,
and fever, this monk possessed, on the
contrary, one of the wisest, most exact, and
most subtle philosophic brains which have
ever existed. He lived, they tell us, in his
hut at Gr&ouml;nendal, in the midst of the forest
of Soignes. It was at the beginning of one
of the wildest centuries of the middle ages,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
fourteenth. He knew no Greek, and
perhaps no Latin. He was alone and poor;
and yet, in the depths of this obscure forest
of Brabant, his mind, ignorant and simple
as it was, receives, all unconsciously, dazzling
sunbeams from all the lonely, mysterious
peaks of human thought He knows, though
he is unaware of it, the Platonism of Greece,
the Sufism of Persia, the Brahmanism of India,
and the Buddhism of Tibet; and his marvellous
ignorance rediscovers the wisdom of
buried centuries, and foresees the knowledge
of centuries yet unborn. I could
quote whole pages of Plato, of Plotinus, of
Porphyry, of the Zendic books, of the Gnostics,
and of the Kabbala, the all but inspired
substance of which is to be found intact in
the writings of this humble Flemish priest.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
We find strange coincidences and disturbing
agreements. We find more, for he seems,
at times, to have presupposed with exactitude
the work of most of his unknown predecessors.
Just as Plotinus begins his stern journey
at the crossroad where Plato, fearing, paused
and knelt down, so we might say that
Ruysbroeck awakened from a slumber of
several centuries; not, indeed, the same kind
of thought (for that kind of thought never
sleeps), but the same kind of language as
that which had fallen asleep on the mountains
where Plotinus forsook it, dazzled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
that blaze of light, and with his hands before
his eyes, as if in presence of an immense
conflagration.</p>

<p>But the organic method of their thought
differs strangely. Plato and Plotinus are
before all things princes in the sphere of
dialectic. They reach mysticism by the
science of reasoning. They use the discursive
faculties of their mind, and seem to
distrust their intuitive or contemplative
faculties. Reasoning beholds itself in the
mirror of reasoning, and endeavours to remain
indifferent to every other reflection.
It continues its course like a river of fresh
water in the midst of the sea, with the
presentiment of a speedy absorption. In
our author we find, on the contrary, the
habits of Asiatic thought; the intuitive
faculty reigns alone above the discursive
purification of ideas by means of words.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
The fetters of the dream have fallen off.
Is it for this reason less sure? None can
tell. The mirror of the human intellect is
entirely unknown in this book, but there is
another mirror, darker and more profound,
which we hide in the inmost depths of our
being; no detail can be seen distinctly, and
words will not remain on its surface; the
intellect would break it if it could for a
moment cast thereon the reflection of its
merely secular light; but something else is
seen there from time to time. Is it the
soul? is it God Himself? is it both at once?
We shall never know; yet these all but
invisible appearances are the only real rulers
of the life of the most unbelieving among us.
Here you will perceive nothing but the
dark reflections on the mirror, and, as its
treasure is inexhaustible, these reflections
are not like anything we have experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
in ourselves, but, in spite of all, they
have an amazing certainty. And this is why
I know nothing more terrifying than this
honest book. There is no psychological
idea, no metaphysical experience, no mystical
intuition, however abstruse, profound, and
surprising they may be, which it would be
impossible to reproduce if necessary, and
to cause to live for a moment in ourselves,
that we might be assured of their
human identity; but here on earth we
are like a blind father who can no longer
recall the faces of his children. None
of these thoughts has the childlike or
brotherly look of a thought of this earth;
we seem to have lost our experience of God,
and yet everything assures us that we are
not entered into the house of dreams.
Must we exclaim with Novalis that the
time has passed away when the Spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
God was comprehensible, and that the
divine sense of the world is forever lost?
That of old all things were manifestations
of the Spirit, but that now we see only
lifeless reflections which we do not understand,
and live entirely on the fruits of
better times?</p>

<p>I believe we must humbly confess that
the key of this book is not to be found on
the common pathways of the human mind.
That key is not meant to open earthly
doors, and we must deserve it by withdrawing
ourselves as far as possible
from the earth. One guide, indeed, we
may still meet at these lonely cross-roads,
who can point out the last way-marks
towards these mysterious isles of fire, these
Icelands of abstraction and of love. That
guide is Plotinus, who attempted to analyse,
by means of the human intellect, the divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
faculty which here holds sway. He experienced
the same ecstasies (as we say
in a word which explains nothing) which
are in their essence only the beginning of
the complete discovery of our being; and in
the midst of their trouble and their darkness,
he never for one moment closed the questioning
eye of the psychologist who seeks to
explain to himself the most abnormal phenomena
of his soul. He is thus like the last
outwork of the pier, from which we may
understand something of the waves and the
horizon of that dim sea. He tries to extend
the paths of the ordinary intellect into the
very heart of these desolations, and this is why
we must constantly revert to him, for he is
the one analytical mystic. For the sake of
those who may be tempted to undertake
this tremendous journey, I give here one
of the pages in which he has attempted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
explain the organism of that divine faculty
of introspection:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the intuition of the intellect,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;intelligible objects are perceived by the intellect
by means of the light which the First
One spreads over them, and in seeing these
objects, it sees really the intelligible light.
But, as it gives its attention to the objects
on which the light falls, it does not perceive
with any exactness the principle which enlightens
them, while if, on the contrary, it
forgets the objects which it sees so as to
contemplate only the brightness which makes
them visible, it sees the light itself and the
principle of the light. But it is never outside
of itself that the intellect can contemplate
the intelligible light. It then resembles
the eye which, without contemplating an
exterior or alien light, and indeed before it
has even perceived it, is suddenly struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
by a brightness which belongs to itself, or
by a ray which darts from itself, and appears
to it in the midst of darkness: it is just the
same when the eye, so as to see no other
objects, closes its lids and draws its light
from itself, or when, pressed by the hand, it
perceives the light which it has in itself.
Then, although seeing no outside thing, it
still sees; it sees even more than at any
other time, for it sees the light. The other
objects which it saw before, although they
were luminous, were not the light itself. So,
when the intellect closes its eye in some
degree to other objects, and concentrates it
on itself, then, seeing nothing, it yet sees,
not an alien light which shines in alien
forms, but its own light, which all at once
shines inwardly with a pure radiance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he says: &#8220;The soul which studies
God must form an idea of Him whom it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
seeks to know; being aware, moreover, to what
greatness it desires to unite itself, and persuaded
that it will find blessedness in that
union, it must plunge into the depths of
divinity, until, instead of contemplating itself,
or the intelligible world, it becomes itself
an object of contemplation, and shines with
the brightness of conceptions which have
their source above.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have here almost all that human
wisdom can tell us; almost all that the
prince of transcendental metaphysicians
could express; as for other explanations,
we must find them in ourselves, in the
depths where all explanation disappears in
its expression. For it is not only in heaven
and earth, but above all in ourselves, that
there are more things than all philosophies
can contain; and as soon as we are no longer
obliged to formulate the mysteries within us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
we are more profound than all that has been
written, and greater than all that exists.</p>

<p>I have translated this book, then, solely
because I believe that the writings of the
mystics are the purest diamonds in the vast
treasure of humanity. A translation may
indeed very easily be useless, for experience
seems to prove that it matters little whether
the mystery of the incarnation of a thought
takes place in darkness or in light; it is
enough that it has taken place. But, however
this may be, the truths of mysticism have
a strange privilege over ordinary truths;
they can neither grow old nor die. There
is no truth which did not, one morning,
come down upon this world, lovely in
strength and in youth, and covered with the
fresh and wondrous dew which lies on things
yet unspoken: to-day you may pass through
the infirmaries of the human soul, where all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
thoughts come day by day to die, and you
will not find there a single mystic thought.
They have the immunity of the angels of
Swedenborg, who progress continually towards
the spring of their youth, so that the
oldest angels appear the youngest; and
whether they come from India, from Greece,
or from the North, they have neither country
nor date, and wherever we meet them, they
are calm and real as God Himself. A work
grows old in exact proportion to its anti-mysticism;
and that is why this book bears
no date. I know that it is unusually obscure,
but I believe that a sincere and honest
author is never obscure in the eternal sense
of the word, because he always understands
himself, and in a way which is infinitely
beyond anything that he says. It is only
artificial ideas which spring up in real
darkness, and flourish solely in literary epochs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and in the insincerity of self-conscious
ages, when the thought of the writer is
poorer than his expression. In the former
case, we have the rich shade of a forest; in
the latter, the gloom of a cavern, in which
only dismal parasites can grow. We must
take into account that unknown world which
our author&#8217;s phrases were meant to enlighten
through the poor double horn-panes of words
and thoughts. Words, as it has been said,
were invented for the ordinary uses of life,
and they are unhappy, restless, and as
bewildered as beggars round a throne, when,
from time to time, some royal soul leads
them elsewhere. And, from another point
of view, is the thought ever the exact image
of that unknown thing which gave it birth?
Do we not always behold in it the shadow
of a conflict like that of Jacob with the
angel, confused in proportion to the stature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of the soul and of the angel? &#8220;Woe to us,&#8221;
says Carlyle, &#8220;if we have nothing in us except
that which we can express and show to
others.&#8221; I know that on these pages there
lies the shadow cast from objects which we
have no recollection of having seen. The
monk does not stop to explain their use to
us, and we shall recognise them only when
we behold the objects themselves on the
other side of this life; but meanwhile, he
has made us look into the distance, and that
is much. I know, besides, that many of his
phrases float almost like transparent icicles
on the colourless sea of silence, but still they
exist; they have been separated from the
waters, and that is sufficient. I am aware,
finally, that the strange plants which he
cultivated on the high peaks of the spirit are
surrounded by clouds of their own, but these
clouds annoy only gazers from below. Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
who have the courage to climb see that they
are the very atmosphere of these plants, the
only atmosphere in which they can blossom
in the shade of non-existence. For this is a
vegetation so subtle that it can scarcely be
distinguished from the silence from which it
has drawn its juices and into which it seems
ready to dissolve. This whole work, moreover,
is like a magnifying glass turned upon
darkness and silence; and sometimes we do
not immediately discern the outline of the
ideas which are still steeped therein. It is
invisible things which appear from time
to time, and some attention is obviously
needed for their recognition. This book is
not too far off from us; probably it is in the
very centre of our humanity; it is we, on
the contrary, who are too far from the book;
and if it seems to us discouraging as the
desert, if the desolation of divine love in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
appears terrible, and the thirst on its summits
unendurable, it is not that the book is too
ancient, but that we ourselves are perhaps
old and sad and lacking in courage, like
gray-haired men in presence of a child.
Plotinus, the great pagan mystic, is probably
right when he says to those who complain
that they see nothing on the heights of introspection:
&#8220;We must first make the organ of
vision analogous and similar to the object
which it is to contemplate. The eye would
never have perceived the sun, if it had not
first taken the form of the sun; so likewise
the soul could never see beauty if it did not
first become beautiful itself; and all men
should begin by making themselves beautiful
and divine, in order that they may
obtain the sight of the beautiful and of
divinity.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of Jean von Ruysbroeck, like
that of most of the great thinkers of this
world, is entirely an inner life. He said
himself, &#8220;I have no concerns outside.&#8221;
Nearly all his biographers, Surius among
others, wrote nearly two centuries after his
death, and their work seems much intermixed
with legend. They show us a holy
hermit, silent, ignorant, amazingly humble,
amazingly good, who was in the habit
of working miracles unawares. The trees
beneath which he prayed were illumined by
an aureole; the bells of a Dutch convent
tolled without hands on the day of his death.
His body, when exhumed five years after his
soul had quitted it, was found in a state of
perfect preservation, and from it rose wonderful
perfumes, which cured the sick who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
brought from neighbouring villages. A few
lines will suffice to give the facts which
are undoubtedly authentic. He was born
in the year 1274 at Ruysbroeck, a little
village between Hal and Brussels. He was
first a priest in the church of Sainte-Gudule;
then, by the advice of the hermit Lambert,
he left the Brabant town and retired to
Gr&ouml;nendal (Green Valley) in the forest of
Soignes, in the neighbourhood of Brussels.
Holy companions soon joined him there,
and with them he founded the abbey of
Gr&ouml;nendal, the ruins of which may be seen
to this day. Attracted by the strange renown
of his theosophy and his supernatural
visions, pilgrims from Germany and Holland,
among them the Dominican Jean Tauler
and Gerhard Groot, came to this retreat
to visit the humble old man, and went
away filled with an admiration of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the memory still lingers in their writings.
He died, according to the <i>Necrologium
Monasterii Viridis Vallis</i>, on the 2nd of
December 1381, and his contemporaries
gave him the title of &#8220;<i>L&#8217;Admirable</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the century of the mystics and the
period of the gloomy wars in Brabant and
Flanders, of stormy nights of blood and
prayers under the wild reigns of the three
Johns, of battles extending into the very forest
where the saints were kneeling. St. Bonaventura
and St. Thomas Aquinas had just died,
and Thomas &agrave; Kempis was about to study
God in that mirror of the absolute which the
inspired Fleming had left in the depths of the
Green Valley; while, first Jehan de Bruges,
and afterwards the Van Eycks, Roger van
der Weyden, Hugues van der Goes, Thierry
Bouts, and Hans Memlinck were to people
with images the lonely <i>Word</i> of the hermit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Here is a list of the writings of Ruysbroeck,
the sum-total of which is very large.
<i>The Book of the Twelve Beguines</i>; <i>The
Mirror of Eternal Salvation</i>; <i>The Book of
the Spiritual Tabernacle</i>; <i>The Sparkling
Stone</i>; <i>The Book of Supreme Truth</i>; <i>The
Book of the Seven Steps of Spiritual Love</i>;
<i>The Book of the Seven Castles</i>; <i>The Book of
the Kingdom of the Beloved</i>; <i>The Book of
the Four Temptations</i>; <i>The Book of the
Twelve Virtues</i>; <i>The Book of Christian
Faith</i>, and <i>The Adornment of the Spiritual
Marriage</i>. There are besides seven letters,
two hymns, and a prayer, to which Surius
gave these titles, <i>Epistolae septem utiles</i>,
<i>Cantiones du&aelig; admodum spirituales</i>, and
<i>Oratio perbrevis sed pia valde</i>, the original
texts of which I have not been able to
discover in any of the Flemish manuscripts.</p>

<p>Some years ago the greater number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
these writings were edited with the utmost
care by a society of Flemish bibliophiles&mdash;<i>De
Maetschappij der Vlaemsche Bibliophilen</i>&mdash;and
most of this translation has
been made from the excellent text of that
edition.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake to give here an
analysis of these different works; such an
analysis would be difficult, monotonous, and
useless. All the books of our author treat
exclusively of the same science: a theosophy
peculiar to Ruysbroeck, the minute study of
the introversion and introspection of the soul,
the contemplation of God above all similitudes
and likenesses, and the drama of the divine
love on the uninhabitable peaks of the spirit.
I shall therefore content myself with giving
some characteristic extracts from each of
these writings.</p>

<p><i>The Book of the Twelve Beguines</i>, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Latin translation of Surius, is entitled <i>De
vera contemplatione, opus pr&aelig;clarum, variis
divinis institutionibus, eo quo Spiritus Sanctus
suggessit ordine descriptis, exuberans</i>. This
title explains more exactly the nature of the
work, but is not to be found in any of the
early manuscripts. The truth is that Ruysbroeck,
following the custom of his age,
seldom gave a title to his writings, and the
titles by which they are now known, as well
as the marginal rubrics of the chapters, have
apparently been interpolated by the copyists.
In the edition of the <i>Maetschappij der
Vlaemsche Bibliophilen</i> we find collected
under the title, <i>Dat boec van den twaelf
beghinen</i>, first of all that treatise on the contemplative
life mentioned by Surius, next
a kind of manual of symbolical astrology,
and lastly some thoughts on the passion
and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
three works are marked off from each other
with more or less distinctness, and Ruysbroeck
evidently fixes the place where he forsakes
the inner universe and descends to the
visible firmament, when he says at the end
of chapter xxxi., &#8220;And after this I leave
the contemplative life, which is God Himself,
and which He grants to those who have
renounced self and have followed His Spirit
to where, in eternal glory, He rejoices in
Himself and in His chosen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first eight chapters of this book
are written in singular and very beautiful
verses, and across their images, on the dark
background of essential love, as across the
windows of a burning convent, there flicker
continually bright spiritual flames, and also
frozen sadnesses, not unlike those of Villon
or of Verlaine.</p>

<p>Here are some of these verses:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Contemplation is a science without mode,</div>
<div class="verse">Above human reason remaining evermore;</div>
<div class="verse">Unto our reason can it not come down,</div>
<div class="verse">Neither above it can reason ever rise.</div>
<div class="verse">Its enlightened freedom is a noble mirror,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein the eternal splendour of God doth shine.</div>
<div class="verse">This modeless freedom hath no manner of its own,</div>
<div class="verse">And before it all the works of reason pale;</div>
<div class="verse">This modeless freedom is not God Himself,</div>
<div class="verse">But it is the light by which we see Him.</div>
<div class="verse">Those who move in this freedom unrestrained</div>
<div class="verse">In the light of God,</div>
<div class="verse">See vast prospects stretching out within them.</div>
<div class="verse">This modeless freedom is more high than reason,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet not without reason;</div>
<div class="verse">All things beholdeth it without surprise&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Surprise is far beneath it</div>
<div class="verse">The life of contemplation is without surprise:</div>
<div class="verse">It sees, but knows not what is seen,</div>
<div class="verse">Above all things is it, and neither this nor that.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Afterwards, the poet, perceiving that his
verses are becoming too obscure, standing as
he is on the threshold of eternal knowledge,
says suddenly and very simply&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Now must I cease from versing</div>
<div class="verse">And speak of contemplation clearly.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>From this point he makes use of a strange
prose, dark as the fearful void into which he
is gazing, resembling that fierce cold which
reigns above all our images, with blue lights
flashing over the black frosts of abstraction.
And when he descends for a moment into
the regions of similitudes, he touches only
the most distant, the most subtle, and the
most unknown; he loves, too, such things as
mirrors, reflections, crystal, fountains, burning
glasses, water-plants, precious stones, glowing
iron, hunger, thirst, fire, fish, the stars, and
everything that helps him to endow his ideas
with visible forms&mdash;forms laid prostrate in
the presence of love on these clear summits
of the soul&mdash;and to give distinctness to
those unheard-of truths which he calmly
reveals. It is needless to say more, for you
shall presently reach the threshold of that
spiritual marriage, and from there behold the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
still tempest of joy, reaching as far as to the
eternal heart of God. In one word, this
man of all others went near to beholding
thought as it will be after death, and
showed a faint shadow of its rich growths
of the future, in the midst of the incomprehensible
effluence of the Holy Trinity. I
believe that this is a work which we shall
perhaps remember elsewhere and always.
You shall see, too, that the most amazing
outbursts of St. Teresa are hardly to be
distinguished from the top of those unlighted,
colourless, and airless glaciers to
which we climb with him &#8220;beyond surprise
and emotion, above reason and the virtues,&#8221;
in the dark symphony of contemplation.</p>

<p>I give a passage from the book: <i>De
altero ver&aelig; contemplationis modo</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;After this comes another mode of contemplation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;Those who have raised themselves into
the absolute purity of their spirits by the
love and reverence which they have for God,
stand in His presence, with open and unveiled
faces. And from the splendour of the
Father a direct light shines on those spirits
in which the thought is naked and free from
similitudes, raised above the senses, above
similitudes, above reason and without reason,
in the lofty purity of the spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;This light is not God, but is a mediator
between the seeing thought and God. It is
a light-ray from God or from the Spirit of the
Father. In it God shows Himself immediately,
not according to the distinction and
the mode of His persons, but in the simplicity
of His nature and His substance; and
in it also the Spirit of the Father speaks
in thought, lofty, naked, and without similitude,
&#8216;Behold me as I behold you.&#8217; At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
same time the keenness of the pure eyes is
revealed, when the direct brightness of the
Father falls upon them, and they behold the
splendour of the Father&mdash;that is to say, the
substance or the nature of God in an immediate
vision, above reason and without
distinction.</p>

<p>&#8220;This brightness and this manifestation
of God give to the contemplative spirit a
real knowledge of the vision of God, as far
as it can be enjoyed in this mortal state. In
order that you may understand me clearly, I
will give you an image from the senses.
When you stand in the dazzling radiance of
the sun, and turn away your eyes from all
colour, from attending to and distinguishing
all the various things which the sun illuminates,
if then you simply follow with your
eyes the brightness of the rays which flow
from the sun, you shall be led into the sun&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
very essence; and so likewise, if you follow
with a direct vision the dazzling rays which
stream from the splendour of God, they will
lead you to the source of your creation, and
there you will find nothing else but God
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>I come now to the second of the works
enumerated above. <i>The Mirror of Eternal
Salvation</i> (<i>Die Spieghel der Ewigher Salicheit</i>)
is, like all the writings of the mystic,
a study of the joys of introversion, or of the
return of man into himself, until he comes
into touch with God. It was sent by the
admirable doctor and eminent contemplator
of the Green Valley &#8220;To the dear Sister
Margaret van Meerbeke, of the convent of
the Clares at Brussels, in the year of our
Lord 1359.&#8221; In some manuscripts the
work is entitled &#8220;Book of the Sacraments,&#8221;
and it is indeed the poem of eucharistic love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
above all distinctions and in the midst of
the blinding effluence of God, where the soul
seems to shake the pollen from its essence and
to have an eternal foreknowledge. Here, as
elsewhere, we would need, in order to realise
even slightly these terrors of love, a language
which has the intrinsic omnipotence of
tongues which are almost immemorial. The
Flemish dialect possesses this omnipotence,
and it is possible that several of its words
still contain images dating from the glacial
epochs. Our author then had at his disposal
one of the very oldest modes of speech, in
which words are really lamps behind ideas,
while with us ideas must give light to words.
I am also disposed to believe that every
language thinks always more than the man,
even the man of genius, who employs it, and
who is only its heart for the time being, and
that this is the reason why an ignorant monk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
like this mysterious Ruysbroeck, was able,
by gathering up his scanty forces in prayers
so many centuries ago, to write works which
hardly correspond to our senses in the present
day. I translate from this book the following
fragment:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;See now, here must our reason and
all definite actions give way; for our
powers become simple in love, and are
silent and bend low before the manifestation
of the Father; for the manifestation of the
Father raises the soul above reason, into
nakedness without similitudes. There the
soul is simple, pure, and emptied of everything,
and in that pure emptiness the Father
shows His divine brightness. Into that
brightness there can enter neither reason nor
the senses, observation nor distinction. All
these things must remain underneath it, for
that measureless brightness dazzles the eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of the spirit, so that their lids must close
under its inconceivable radiance. But the
naked eye, above reason, and in the inmost
depths of intelligence, is always open, and
beholds and contemplates with naked vision
that light by that light itself. There we
have eye to eye, glass to glass, image to
image. By these three things we are like
unto God, and are united to Him. For this
vision which strikes upon our naked eye is a
living mirror which God has made in His
image. His image is His divine brightness,
and with it He has filled to overflowing the
mirror of our soul, so that no other brightness
and no other image can enter there.
But this brightness is not an intermediary
between God and us; for it is the thing
which we see, and also the light by which
we see, but not our eye which sees. For
although the image of God is without intermediary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
in the mirror of our soul, and is
united to Him, still the image is not the
mirror, for God does not become the creature.
But the union of the image with the mirror
is so great and so noble that the soul is
called the mirror of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Further, that very image of God which
we have received and which we carry in our
souls is the Son of God, the eternal mirror
of divine wisdom, in which we all dwell, and
are continually reflected. Yet we are not
the wisdom of God, otherwise we should
have created ourselves, which is impossible
and a suggestion savouring of heresy. For
whatever we are and whatever we have, we
have received all from God and not from
ourselves. And although this sublimity is
so great a thought for our soul, yet is it
hidden from the sinner and from many
righteous persons. And all that we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
know by the light of nature is incomplete
and savourless and without emotion, for we
cannot contemplate God or find Him reigning
in our souls without His aid and grace,
and without diligently exercising ourselves
in His love.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Book of the Spiritual Tabernacle</i>
(<i>Dat boec van den Gheesteleken Tabernacule</i>).
<i>In Tabernaculum Mosis et ad id pertinentia
commentaria, ubi multa etiam Exodi, Levitici,
Numerorum mysteria, divino spiritu explicantur</i>,
as Surius describes it, is the longest work
of the hermit, and contains a strange, na&iuml;ve,
and arbitrary interpretation of the symbols of
the ark of the covenant, and of the sacrifices
of the ancient law. I shall give somewhat
copious extracts from this work, for it shows
an interesting and brotherly aspect of his
Flemish soul; and the artistic subtlety with
which he labours to elucidate his emblems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
as well as his amusing and childlike delight
in certain effects of colour and of figures,
reminds us now and then of his marvellous
contemporaries of the Cologne school, the
old dreamy painters, Meister Wilhelm and
Lochner, and of the splendid succession of
nameless dreamers, who, in lands far off
from his, gave a fixed form to the almost
supernatural reflections of the spiritual joys
of that and the following century, which
passed away so near to God and so far from
earth.</p>

<p>Here is what he says with regard to the
offering of the poor as commanded in the
Jewish law:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they (the doves) shall keep near
streams and beside clear waters, so that if
any bird flies downwards to seize them or
to do them any injury, they may recognise
him by his reflection in the water and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
beware of him. The clear water is Holy
Scripture, the lives of saints, and the mercy
of God. We shall reflect ourselves therein
when we are tempted, and so none shall
be able to hurt us. These doves have a
loving nature, and young doves are often
born of them, for whenever, to the glory of
God and for our own felicity, we think of
sin with scorn and hatred, and of virtue with
love, we give birth to young doves&mdash;that is
to say, to new virtues.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the following passages he pictures,
with the help of these same doves, the offering
of Saint Paul:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our Lord replied that His grace
should be sufficient for him, for virtue is
perfected in the weakness of temptations.
When he understood this he offered these
two doves into the hands of our Lord. For
he renounced self, and willingly became poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
and bent the necks of his doves (that is, his
desires) under the hands of our Lord Jesus
Christ and of the Holy Church. And
Christ broke the necks and the wings of the
doves, and then he became incapable of
desiring or of flying towards any desire
except that which was God&#8217;s will. And then
Christ placed the head (that is to say, the
will, which was dead and powerless) under
the broken wings, and then the doves were
ready to be consumed; and so the holy
apostle says: &#8216;Most gladly, therefore, will
I rather glory in my weakness, that the
power of Christ may rest upon me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us consider further the extraordinary
interpretation of the spiritual flowers embroidered
on the hangings of the tabernacle:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;On these four curtains of divers colours
the Lord ordered Bezaleel and Aholiab to
weave and to embroider with the needle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
many ornaments. So likewise our obedient
will and our intelligence will place upon
these four colours divers ornaments of
virtues. On the white colour of innocence
we shall place red roses, by evermore resisting
all that is evil. Thus we maintain
purity and crucify our own nature, and these
red roses with their sweet perfume are very
lovely on the white colour. Again, upon
innocence we shall embroider sunflowers, by
which we mean obedience; for when the
sun rises in the east, the sunflower opens
towards its rays, and turns ever eagerly
towards the sun, even until its setting in
the west; and at night it closes and hides
its colours and awaits the return of the
sun. Even so will we open our hearts by
obedience towards the illumination of the
grace of God, and humbly and eagerly will
we follow that grace so long as we feel the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
warmth of love. And when the light of
grace ceases to awaken fresh emotions, and
we feel the warmth of love but little, or feel
it not at all, then it is night, when we shall
close our heart to all that may tempt it; and
so shall we shut up within ourselves the
golden colour of love, awaiting a new dawn,
with its new brightness and its fresh emotions;
and thus shall we preserve innocence always
in its pristine splendour. On the blue
colour, which is like the firmament, we shall
embroider birds with varied plumage; in
other words, we shall keep before our minds,
with clear observation, the lives and the works
of the saints, which are manifold. These
works are their varied plumage, so gracious
and so beautiful, and with this they adorned
themselves and soared to heaven. They are
birds which we must observe with attention;
if we are like them in their plumage, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
shall follow them to their eternal rest. On
the purple colour (that is, violet or blood-red,
meaning generosity) we shall place water-lilies,
and these symbolise the free possession
of all the treasures of God. For we notice
four things in the water-lily. It keeps itself
always above the water, and has four green
leaves between the air and the water; and it
is rooted in the earth, and above it is opened
out to the sun; and it is a remedy for those
who are fevered. So also may we, by
generosity and freedom of spirit, possess the
waves of all the riches of God. And between
this free possession by our spirit and the
waves of the lavish gifts of God, we shall
have green leaves&mdash;that is to say, an
earnest consideration of the way in which
the eternal liberality of God flows forth,
with ever new gifts to men, and we
shall consider also how the gifts are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
bestowed with discrimination, according to
the nature of the beloved ones who receive
them, and how the final cause of all the
gifts is the generous outflow of divine love;
and the more immediate cause the wisdom
and generosity in human creatures, which
makes them resemble God. For none can
know the wealth of the gifts of God except
the wise and generous man, who, out of the
treasures of God, can give wisely and
generously to all creatures. So shall we
adorn generosity, and then we shall be
rooted in the soil of all the gifts&mdash;that is to
say, in the Holy Spirit, as the water-lily is
rooted deep down under the water. And we
shall open our hearts in the air above, towards
truth and towards the sun of righteousness.
And thus we are a remedy for all the world;
for the generous heart which possesses the
treasures of God, ought to fill, console,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
refresh, and cool all those who are afflicted.
And it is thus that the purple colour is
adorned with the red colour&mdash;that is to say,
with burning love. On it we shall place
bright stars, by which I mean pious and
devout prayer for the good of our neighbour,
and reverent and secret communion between
God and ourselves. These are the stars
which illuminate with their brightness the
kingdoms of heaven and of earth, and they
make us inwardly light-giving and fruit-bearing,
and fix us in the firmament of
eternal life.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall next translate the whole of the
&#8220;chapter on fishes,&#8221; with its amazing analogies:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is why the symbolic law ordered
the Jews to eat clean fish, which had
scales and fins; and all other fish were
unclean and were forbidden by the law.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
By this we understand that our inner life
ought to have a clothing of virtues, and our
inward devotions ought to be covered with
the application of our reason, just as the
fish is clothed and adorned with its scales.
And our loving power should move in four
different ways:&mdash;in triumphing over our own
will, in loving God, in desiring to resist
our own nature, and in seeking to acquire
virtues. These are four fins between which
our inward life should swim, as fish do, in
the water of divine grace. The fish has
besides, in the middle of its body, a straight
fin, which remains motionless in all its
movements. So our inward feelings, firmly
centred, should be empty of everything and
without personal preference; in other words,
we should allow God to act in us and in
all things, both in heaven and earth. The
fourth scale balances us in the mercy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
God and in true divine peace. And so
our devotion has fins and scales and becomes
for us a pure nourishment which pleases
God. But the scales which clothe and
adorn our inward exercises should be of
four colours, for some fish have gray scales,
others red scales, others green scales, and
others again white scales. The gray scales
teach us that the images with which we
clothe our devotions must be humble; in
other words, we must think of our sins,
of our want of virtue, of the humility of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and of His mother, and
of all things which may abase and humble
us, and we shall love poverty and contempt
and to be unknown and despised by everybody.
This is the gray colour, which is
very beautiful in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Further, we shall clothe our devotions
with red scales&mdash;that is to say, we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
remember that the Son of God laid down His
life for love of us, and we shall keep His
passion in our memory, like a glorious
mirror before our inward eyes, so that we
may remember His love and console ourselves
in all our sorrows. And we shall also
think of the many torments of the martyrs,
who by their sufferings followed our Lord
into eternal life. These are red scales, set
well in order, and they are a delightful
clothing for our inward emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, again, we shall adorn our secret
thoughts with green scales. I mean that we
shall earnestly meditate upon the noble
lives of confessors and saints, remembering
how they despised the world, and by what
wonderful work and in what divers ways
they honoured and served God. Green is
the colour which attracts and rejoices loving
hearts and willing eyes. Let us stir our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
fins, then, and follow the saints by imitating
their good works to the utmost of our
power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, we shall clothe our inward
exercise with white scales; in other words,
we shall glass ourselves in the purity of
virgins, and shall observe how they fought
and how they conquered flesh and blood,
by which is meant the inclination of nature.
This is why they wear the crown of gold
and follow the Lamb, who is Christ, with
new songs, which none shall sing save
those who have preserved chastity in soul
and body. But if we have lost purity, we
may still acquire innocence and clothe
ourselves with other virtues, and so we may
reach the day of judgment shining brighter
than the sun, and possess the glory of God
through an unending eternity. In this way,
then, we shall cover our inward devotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
with four kinds of scales, and each kind
shall have the active fins of good-will;
that is, we must desire to carry out in good
works that which we understand by our
intelligence. So shall our spiritual nourishment
be clean; for knowledge and wisdom
without a virtuous life are like scales without
fins; and practical virtues without reflection
are fins without scales; and so we
must know, love, and practise virtues, in
order that our life may be pure; and then
we shall be nourished with clean fish which
have scales and fins.&#8221;</p>

<p>I give next the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Further, each lamp had a vase of gold,
full of water, in which was extinguished the
fire taken away from the wicks. By this we
learn that every gift demands from our
mind a desire towards every cardinal virtue&mdash;a
desire so simple that we can feel in ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the yearning of love after union with
God. We observe this in Jesus Christ, who
is our mirror in all things; for in every
virtue which He practised, He excelled so
lovingly that He sought ardently after union
with His Father. And we shall unite all
our yearnings in that loving yearning which
He felt towards His Father in all cardinal
virtues. For our loving yearnings are our
golden vases, full of water&mdash;that is, of truth
and righteousness&mdash;we shall plunge into
them our burning wicks, the acts, that is, of
all the virtues which we have practised; we
shall plunge them in and extinguish them,
by commending ourselves to His righteousness,
and by uniting ourselves to His
adorable merits; without this the wick of
all our virtues would smoke and would have
an evil savour before God and before all
His saints.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Elsewhere, he examines the twelve jewels
of the Breastplate, and sees in them reflections
of eternal symbols, as well as unsuspected,
precise, and suggestive analogies.
Let us see whether it is not so.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the rays of the sun, the topaz surpasses
in splendour all precious stones; and
even so does the humanity of our Lord
Jesus Christ excel in glory and in majesty
all the saints and all the angels because of
His union with the eternal Father. And in
this union the reflection of the Divine Sun
is so clear and glorious that it attracts and
reflects in its clearness all the eyes of saints
and angels in immediate vision, and those
also of just men to whom its splendour is
revealed. So likewise does the topaz attract
and reflect in itself the eyes of those who
behold it, because of its great clearness.
But if you were to cut the topaz it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
darken, while if you leave it in its natural
state it will remain clear. And so, too, if
you examine and try to penetrate the splendour
of the eternal Word, that splendour
will darken and you will lose it. But leave
it as it is, and follow it with earnest gaze, and
with self-abnegation, and it will give you
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us next consider the curious correspondences
which he discovered in other
precious stones:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this article we compare Christ to the
noble sapphire, of which there are two kinds.
The first is yellow with shades of purple
and seems to be mingled with powdered
gold; the other is sky-blue, and in the
rays of the sun it gives forth a burning splendour,
and one cannot see through it. And we
find all this in our Lord, in this fifth article of
the creed. For when His noble soul rose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
heaven, His body lay in the tomb&mdash;yellow,
because of the soul&#8217;s departure; purple,
because of His bleeding wounds; and mingled
with powdered gold because He was united
to the divine nature. And His soul descended
into hell, blue as the sky, so that all
his friends rejoiced and were glad in His
splendour; and in His resurrection the splendour
becomes so great and so powerful, both
in body and soul, through the illumination
of the Divine Sun, that it darts forth lightnings
and burning rays, and inflames with
love all things which it touches. And none
can see through that noble sapphire, Christ,
because in His divine nature there is a depth
unfathomable.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pass over the amethyst &#8220;from which
red roses seem to flow forth,&#8221; and as a
closing passage from this work, I shall
translate the last three symbols: those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of the chrysolite, the emerald, and the
jasper.</p>

<p>First of all, the chrysolite:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The communion of saints and the forgiveness
of sins are obtained by the <i>waves
of the night</i>&mdash;that is to say, by two sacraments
of the Holy Church, baptism and penance.
These are the waves which by faith wash
that night of darkness, sin. And God has
sworn, even from the time of Abraham, that
He would give Himself to us and would
become our familiar friend, and because of
His all-embracing and overflowing love, He
has willed to wash us in His blood. And
in order that we might believe without doubting
in the oath which He sware by Himself,
He has sealed it with His own death, and has
given the merits of His death to all men
in the Holy Church for the remission of
sins, and to the saints, for the adornment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
their glory. That precious stone, the chrysolite,
symbolises to us that article of the
creed, &#8216;the communion of saints, the forgiveness
of sins,&#8217; for it is like the waves of the sea,
translucent and green, and moreover it has
gleams of gold. And so likewise all saints
and just men are translucent by grace or by
glory, and they are green by their holy
life, and they gleam with the gold of divine
love which shines through them. And
these three adornments are common to all
saints and to all just persons, for they are
the treasure of the holy churches, here and in
eternal life. And all who by penance have
put away from them the colour of the Red Sea&mdash;that
is, a sinful life&mdash;are like the chrysolite.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must know that this sea is red
because of its country and the colour of its
bed. It is between Jericho and Zoar,
Jericho signifies &#8216;the moon,&#8217; and Zoar the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
beast which blinds the reason. Between the
moon of inconstancy and the inclination
of reason towards the beast, there is always
the Red Sea&mdash;that is to say, an impure life.
No creature can live in the Red Sea, and
whatever does not live in it sinks to the
bottom; and that is why it is called the
Dead Sea, because there is no movement in
it, and it is like bitumen or pitch, because
it seizes and slays whatever enters it, and in
this way it very closely resembles sin, which
seizes man and puts him to spiritual death in
the sight of God, and plunges him into hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us see, lastly, how he applies the
emerald and the jasper to the third and
sixth articles of the Apostles&#8217; Creed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this article we compare to the Son of
God that beautiful stone which is called the
emerald, and which is so green that neither
leaves nor grass nor any other green thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
can compare with its viridity. And it fills
and feeds with its greenness the eyes of those
who behold it. Now when the eternal Word
of the Father was made man, then was seen
the greenest colour ever known on earth.
That union of natures is so green and so
lovely and so joyful, that no other colour can
equal it; and so in a holy vision it has filled
and fed the eyes of such men as have prepared
themselves to perceive it. Nothing is
more lovely and more pleasant to the eye
than the emerald when it has been cut and
polished, and everything that it reflects may
be recognised and seen as in a mirror. And
so, if we examine in detail the divine being
of Him who took our nature through His
love for us, we must needs admire, and we
cannot sufficiently praise its sublimity.
And when we consider how He became
man, we must be ashamed of ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
remembering His humility, and we cannot
abase ourselves too deeply. And when we
remember what His motive was in becoming
man, we cannot rejoice enough or love Him
as He deserves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In these three ways we shall behold with
eager desire, and we shall polish and lovingly
examine Christ our noble emerald;
and so doing, we shall find nothing more
pleasant to the eyes of our reason, nothing
more attractive, for we shall find Him reflected
in us, and we shall find ourselves
re-echoed in Him through His grace and a
virtuous life, and so we shall turn away from
earthly things and keep this mirror ever
before our eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;In another article we compare Christ
to the noble jasper, which has a green
colour, very pleasant to the eye; and it
almost equals the emerald in its greenness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
And so we compare it to the ascension of
our Lord, who was green and beautiful in the
eyes of the apostles, and so pleasant that
they could never forget Him during all their
lives. And we shall rightly have the same
experience; we shall consider that the noble
emerald, the eternal Word, descended into
our nature because of His love for us,
with an overflowing greenness, and we shall
rejoice in this above all, for this vision is full
of grace. We shall further consider that the
glorious jasper, by which I mean our Lord
Jesus, ascended to heaven wearing our nature,
and is seated at the right hand of the
Father, and has prepared for us the state of
glory&mdash;Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next comes <i>The Book of the Twelve
Virtues</i>, which Laurentius Surius entitles
more exactly <i>Tractatus de pr&aelig;cipuis quibusdam
virtutibus</i>. In it the hermit of Gr&ouml;nendal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
seems to have made a violent effort to
open his bodily eyes, and all his thoughts
are intertwined with the simplicity of divine
children, in the green and blue rays of
humility and mercy, while his prose, which
is usually quite impersonal, is enlivened here
with various counsels and practical matters.</p>

<p>Here is a fragment on humility:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To reach the lowest place is to have no
longer any desire towards evil; and as we
have always some sin to forsake, so long
as we are in this mortal life, we never reach
the lowest place, for to die is to attain, not
according to the senses, but in a spiritual
paradox. And if any one were to say that
to be steeped in humility is to have reached
the lowest place, I should not contradict his
opinion. But it seems to me that to bathe
oneself in humility is to bathe oneself in
God, for God is the source of humility, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
He is at the same height and the same depth
above and below all places. And between
self-abasement and the attainment of the
lowest place, there is, to my mind, a difference.
For to reach the lowest place is to
have no longer any desire towards evil, and
to experience self-abasement is to be steeped
in humility, and that is self-annihilation in
God and death in God. Now, we have
always something to forsake so long as we
live, and to have nothing more to forsake is
to have reached the lowest place. This is
why we cannot attain to the lowest place.
For what man was ever so humble that he
could not have been more humble still? and
who ever loved so fervently that he could
not have loved more fervently still? Except
Christ, assuredly not one. And so let us
never be satisfied while in this dying life,
for we may always become more humble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
than we are to-day. It is a most joyful
thought that we have so great and good a
God that we can never give Him sufficient
homage and praise. Yes, not even if each
single man could give every moment that
which is given by all men and by all angels.
But if we steep ourselves in humility, that is
enough, and we please God by Himself, for
in that immersion we are <i>one life</i> in Him,
not according to nature, but by being bathed
in humility, because by humility we have
descended below our creation, and we have
flowed into God, who is the source of
humility. And there we lack nothing, for
we are beyond ourselves and in God, and
there is neither giving nor receiving, nor
anything which can be called <i>there</i>, for it
is neither <i>there</i> nor <i>here</i>, but I know not
where.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the same book I transcribe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
following passage on detachment from all
things:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, he who has found God thus reigning
in him by His grace, and who dwells in
God above the measure of his human
strength, may remain insensible to joy, to
grief, and to the multitude of creatures. For
God is <i>essenced</i> in him, and he is more disposed
to introversion than to extroversion;
and this essence is recalled to him wherever
man is found; and this inclination and this
essence are never forgotten, unless the man
should deliberately turn away from God;
and this he will not readily do, for he who
has experienced God in this way cannot
easily turn away from Him. I do not say
that this can never happen, for no one is
certain of anything in this mortal life,
except of certain revelations.</p>

<p>&#8220;God takes by His divine power the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
whom he has <i>essenced</i> in himself in this way,
and enlightens him in everything, for everything
is full to him of divine enjoyment;
for he who refers all things to the glory of
God, enjoys God in all things, and he sees
in them the image of God. For he takes
all from the hand of God, thanks Him and
praises Him in everything, and God shines
ever brightly before him, for he watches God
with close attention, and never willingly turns
away to worthless things. And as soon as
he sees that he has turned towards worthless
things, he at once turns away from them with
great bitterness against himself, and bewails
his unfaithfulness to God and resolves never
again to turn knowingly towards worthless
things. For all is bare and empty in which
there is not either the glory of God or the
good of our neighbour or our own salvation.
He who thus watches over himself is less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and less distracted, for his friend is often
present with him, and that delights him
above all. He is like to one who has a
burning thirst. In his thirst he does nothing
but drink. He may think of many other
things besides the thirst which consumes
him; but whatever he does, and whoever he
is, or of whatever object he thinks, the image
of drink does not disappear from his mind so
long as he suffers from thirst. And the longer
the thirst endures, the greater is the suffering
of the man. And it is even so with the man
who loves anything so passionately that he
has no taste for aught besides, while nothing
really touches his heart except that with
which he is busied, and on which his love is
set. Wherever he may be, with whomsoever
he may find himself, nothing removes from
him that which he so ardently loves. And
he sees in all things the image of the beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
object; and the greater and more powerful
his love, the more vividly that image is
present to him. He does not seek repose
and idleness that he may enjoy it, for no
distraction hinders him from having the
image of the beloved abiding ever with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us glance next at the little work on
<i>Christian Faith</i>, to which Surius gives the
title <i>De fide et judicio, tractatulus insignis</i>.
Its twenty pages form a kind of catechism,
splendid in its precision, from which I take
the following fragment on the happiness of
the elect:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall behold with our inward eyes
the mirror of the wisdom of God, in which
shall shine and be illumined all things which
have ever existed and which can rejoice our
hearts. And we shall hear with our outward
ears the melody and the sweet songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of saints and angels, who shall praise God
throughout eternity. And with our inner
ears we shall hear the inborn Word of the
Father; and in this Word we shall receive
all knowledge and all truth. And the
sublime fragrance of the Holy Spirit shall
pass before us, sweeter than all balms and
precious herbs that ever were; and this
fragrance shall draw us out of ourselves,
towards the eternal love of God, and we
shall taste His everlasting goodness, sweeter
than all honey, and it shall feed us, and
enter into our soul and our body; and we
shall be ever an hungered and athirst for
it, and because of our hunger and thirst,
these delights and this nourishment shall
remain with us for ever, ever more renewed;
and this is eternal life.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall understand by love and we shall
be understood by love, and God shall possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
us and we Him in unity. We shall enjoy
God, and, united to Him, we shall rest in
blessedness. And this measureless delight,
in that super-essential rest, is the ultimate
source of blessedness, for we are then
swallowed up in satisfaction beyond all
possibility of hunger. Hunger can have no
place in it, for there is nothing here but
unity; all loving spirits shall here fall asleep
in super-essential darkness, and nevertheless
they shall live and wake for ever in the
light of glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next we come to <i>The Book of the Sparkling
Stone, De Calculo, sive de perfectione
filiorum Dei, libellus admirabilis</i>, as Surius
adds. Here the subject is the mysterious
stone of which the Spirit says in the Apocalypse:
<i>Et dabo illi (vincenti) calculum candidum,
et in calculo nomen novum scriptum,
quod nemo scit nisi qui accepit</i> (Rev. ii. 17).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
This stone, according to the monk of the
forest of Soignes, is the symbol of Christ,
given to His loved ones only, and like a
flame which images the love of the eternal
Word. And then again we have glimpses of
those dark shadows of love, from which break
forth uninterrupted sobs of light, seen in
awful flowers through the gradual expansions
of contemplation and above the strange
verdure of an unequalled gladness. Let us
examine this passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hence follows the third point, that is
to say, an inward exercise above reason and
without restraint; for that union with God
which every loving spirit has possessed in love
continually attracts and draws towards the inmost
centre of its essence the divine persons
and all loving spirits; and all those who love
feel this attraction, more or less, according to
their love and their holy exercises. And he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
who keeps guard over this attraction and
clings closely to it cannot fall into deadly sin.
But the contemplative one, who has renounced
his own being and all things else, does not experience
an expulsive force, because he no
longer possesses anything, but is emptied of
all; and so he can always enter naked and
imageless into the secret place of his spirit.
There he sees the eternal light revealed, and
in that light he feels an eternal craving for
union with God. And he himself feels a constant
fire of love which desires above all
things to be one with God. And the more
he observes that attraction and that craving,
the more keenly he feels it; and the more he
feels it, the more he desires to be one with
God, for he longs to pay the debt which
God calls on him to pay. This eternal
craving for union with God causes the spirit
to glow evermore with love; but as the spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
uninterruptedly continues paying its debt, a
perpetual consumption goes on within it;
for in the refreshment of unity all spirits grow
weary in their task, and feel only the absorption
of everything into simple unity with God.
This simple unity can be felt and possessed
by none save by those who stand before the
immense brightness and before love, above
reason and without restraint. In this presence
the spirit feels itself perpetually inflamed
with love; and in this glow of love
it finds neither beginning nor end. And it
feels itself <i>one</i> with that burning fire of love.
The spirit remains always on fire in itself, for
its love is eternal, and it feels itself always
consumed away in love; for it is attracted
towards the refreshment of union with God, in
which the spirit burns with love. If it observes
itself, it finds a distinction and a difference
between itself and God, but where it burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
it is pure and has no distinction, and that is
why it feels nothing else but unity; for the
immeasurable flame of the divine love consumes
and swallows up all that it has
enveloped in its essence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you may thus understand that the
attracting unity of God is nothing else save
boundless love, which lovingly draws inwards,
in eternal enjoyment, the Father,
the Son, and all who live in love. And we
desire to burn and be consumed in that love
everlastingly, for in it the blessedness of all
spirits is found. And so we ought all to
found our lives on a fathomless abyss; we
shall thus be able to descend evermore in
love, and to plunge ourselves beyond ourselves
into its unsounded depths; and by the
same love we shall rise and go beyond ourselves
into its inconceivable height, and we
shall wander in that measureless love, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
will lead us away into the boundless expanse
of the love of God. And there will be a
flow and outflow beyond ourselves, in the
unknown pleasure of the divine goodness
and riches. There will be an eternal fusion
and transfusion, absorption and perabsorption
of ourselves in the glory of God. See how,
in each of these comparisons, I have shown
to the contemplative mind its essence and its
inward exercises. But no other can understand
me, for no man can teach contemplation
to his fellow. But when the eternal
truth is revealed to the spirit, it is instructed
in all that is needful.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ought in fairness to translate also the many
strange things in chapters vi., vii., and viii.,
which deal with &#8220;The difference between the
hirelings and the faithful servants of God,&#8221;
&#8220;The difference between the faithful servants
and the secret friends of God,&#8221; and &#8220;The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
difference between the secret friends and the
hidden sons of God.&#8221; Here it does really
seem as if the anchorite of the Green
Valley had dipped into things beyond this
world. But having run to such lengths
already, I can hardly attempt it I must,
however, be permitted to give the following
fragment, which shall be the last from this
book. It is strangely beautiful:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Understand, now, that this is the mode
of progress: in our going towards God, we
ought to carry our being and all our works
before us, as an eternal offering to God; and
in presence of God we shall surrender ourselves
and all our works, and, dying in love,
we shall pass beyond all creation into the
super-essential kingdom of God. There we
shall possess God in an eternal death to
ourselves. And this is why the Spirit of
God says in the book of the Apocalypse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
&#8216;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.&#8217;
Rightly indeed does He call them the blessed
dead, for they remain continually dead to
themselves and immersed beyond their own
nature in the gladdening unity of God. And
they die ever newly in love, by the attracting
refreshment of that same unity. Furthermore,
the divine Spirit saith, &#8216;They shall
rest from their labours, and their works
shall follow them.&#8217; In this finite existence,
where we are born of God into
a spiritual and virtuous life, we carry
our works before us as an offering to
God; but in that unconditioned life, where
we die anew in God, into a life of
everlasting blessedness, our good works
follow us, for they are one life with
us. In our walk towards God, God dwells
within us; but in our death to ourselves and
to all things besides, we dwell in God. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
we have faith, hope, and love, we have received
God, and He dwells in us with His
mercies, and He sends us out as His faithful
servants, to keep His commandments. And
He calls us in as His mysterious friends, and
we obey His counsels. But above all things,
if we desire to enjoy God, or to experience
eternal life within us, we must rise far above
human reason, and enter into God through
faith; and there we shall remain pure, at
rest, and free from all similitudes, lifted by
love into the open nakedness of thought.
For when in love we die to all things, when
in ignorance and obscurity we die to all the
notice of the world, we are wrought and reformed
by the eternal Word, who is an image
of the Father. And in the repose of our spirit
we receive the incomprehensible splendour
which envelops and penetrates us, just as
the air is penetrated by the brightness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the sun. And this splendour is merely a
boundless vision and a boundless beholding.
What we are, that we behold; and what we
behold, that we are; for our thought, our
life, and our essence are closely united with
that truth which is God, and are raised along
with it. And that is why in this pure vision
we are one life and one spirit with God; and
this is what I call a contemplative life. By
connecting ourselves closely to God through
love, we choose the better part; but when
we thus behold God in super-essence, we
possess Him altogether. This contemplation
is united with an untrammelled inward
devotion, that is to say, with a life in which
earthly things are destroyed; for when we
go outside ourselves into darkness and
into unlimited freedom, the pure ray of
the brightness of God shines perpetually on
us; we are fixed in the ray, and it draws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
us out of ourselves into our super-essence
till we are overwhelmed in love. And this
overwhelming in love is always accompanied
and followed by the free inward exercise
of love. For love cannot be idle; it
longs by knowledge and taste to enter
into the immense riches which dwell in
its inmost heart; and its hunger is inappeasable.
To be always receiving in
this powerlessness is to swim against the
stream. We can neither leave nor take, do
without nor receive, speak nor be silent, for
it is above reason and intelligence, and
higher than all created beings. And so
we can neither attain nor pursue it; but we
shall look within, and there we shall feel
that the Spirit of God is leading us and
drawing us on in this impatience of love.
We shall look above, and there we shall
feel that the Spirit of God is drawing us out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
of ourselves, and that we are lost in Him&mdash;that
is, in the super-essential love with which
we are one, and which we possess more
deeply and more widely than all other
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;This possession is a pure and profound
enjoyment of all good and of eternal life;
and we are swallowed up in this enjoyment,
above reason and without reason, in the
deep calm of Godhead, which shall nevermore
be stirred. It is by experience only
that we can know that this is true. For
how this is, or who, or in what place, or
what, neither reason nor inward exercise can
tell us, and it is for this reason that our
inward exercise which follows must remain
without mode or limit. For we can neither
conceive nor understand the unfathomable
good which we possess and enjoy; neither
by our inward exercises can we go out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
ourselves to enter into it. And so we are
poor in ourselves, but rich in God; hungry
and thirsty in ourselves, satiated and full
of wine in God; laborious in ourselves, in
God enjoying perfect rest. And thus we
shall remain throughout eternity. For
without the exercises of love we can never
possess God, and he who feels or thinks
otherwise is deceived. And thus we live
wholly in God, by possessing our beatitude,
and we live wholly in ourselves by exercising
our souls in love towards God; and although
we live wholly in God and wholly in ourselves,
yet it is but one life, which has two-fold
and contrary sensations. For riches and
poverty, hunger and satiety, work and idleness,
these things are absolutely contrary to
one another. Nevertheless, in this consists
the nobility of our nature, now and everlastingly,
for it is impossible that we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
become God, or lose our created essence.
But if we remain wholly in ourselves,
separated from God, we shall be miserable
and unsaved; and so we ought to feel
ourselves living wholly in God and wholly
in ourselves, and between these two sensations
we shall find nothing but the grace of
God and the exercises of our love. For
from the height of our highest sensation, the
splendour of God shines upon us, and it
teaches us truth and impels us towards all
virtues into the eternal love of God. Without
interruption we follow this splendour on
to the source from which it flows, and there
we feel that our spirits are stripped of all
things and bathed beyond thought of rising
in the pure and infinite ocean of love. If
we remained there continually, with a pure
vision, we should never lose this experience,
for our immersion in the enjoyment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
God would be without interruption, if we had
gone out of ourselves and were swallowed
up in love, so possessing God. For if, overwhelmed
in love, and lost to ourselves, we
are the possessors of God, God is ours and
we are His, and we plunge far beyond our
depth, eternally and irrevocably having God
as our own. This immersion in love
becomes the habit of our being, and so it
takes place while we sleep and while we
wake, whether we know it or whether we
know it not. And in this way it deserves
no other praise; but it maintains us in
possession of God and of all the good which
we have received from His hands. It is like
unto streams, which, without pause and without
returning, flow continually into the sea,
since that is the place to which they belong.
And so, if we possess God alone, the immersion
of our being through habitual love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
is always, and without return, flowing into
an unfathomable emotion, which we possess,
and which belongs to us. If we were always
pure, and if we always beheld with the same
directness of vision, we should have such a
feeling as this. Now, this immersion in
love is above all virtues, and above all the
practices of love. For it is simply an
eternal going forth out of ourselves, by a
clear prevision, into a changed state, towards
which we lean out of ourselves, as if towards
our beatitude. For we feel ourselves eternally
drawn outside ourselves and towards
another. And this is the most secret and
the most hidden distinction which we can
experience between God and ourselves, and
above it there is no more any difference.
Nevertheless, our reason remains with its
eyes open in the darkness&mdash;that is to say,
in infinite ignorance&mdash;and in that darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the boundless splendour remains secret and
hidden from us, for the presence of its immensity
blinds our reason. But it wraps us
round with its purity and transforms us by
its essence, and so we are wrought out of
our personality and transformed until, overwhelmed
in love, we possess our beatitude,
and are one with God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us next look at <i>The Book of the
Seven Steps of the Ladder of Love</i> (called
by Surius <i>De Septem Gradibus amoris,
libellus optimus</i>) in which the prior of Gr&ouml;nendal
studies seven virtues which lead from
introversion to the confines of absorption.
This seems to me one of the most beautiful
works of a saint, whose works are all
strange and beautiful I ought to translate
from it some rather singular passages; among
others, that in which he discusses the four
melodies of heaven; but space fails us, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
this introduction is already too long. I
shall content myself with giving the following
page:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Holy Spirit cries in us with a loud
voice and without words, &#8216;Love the love
which loves you everlastingly.&#8217; His crying
is an inward contact with our spirit. This
voice is more terrifying than the storm. The
flashes which it darts forth open the sky to
us and show us the light of eternal truth.
The heat of its contact and of its love is so
great that it well-nigh consumes us altogether.
In its contact with our spirit it
cries without interruption, &#8216;Pay your debt;
love the love which has loved you from
all eternity.&#8217; Hence there arises a great
inward impatience and also an unlimited
resignation. For the more we love, the more
we desire to love; and the more we pay of
that which love demands, the greater becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
our debt to love. Love is not silent, but
cries continually, &#8216;Love thou love.&#8217; This
conflict is unknown to alien senses. To
love and to enjoy, that is to labour and to
suffer. God lives in us by His grace. He
teaches us, He counsels us, He commands
us to love. We live in Him above all grace
and above our own works, by suffering and
enjoying. In us dwell love, knowledge, contemplation,
and possession, and, above them,
enjoyment. Our work is to love God; our
enjoyment is to receive the embrace of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between love and enjoyment there is a
distinction, even as between God and His
grace. We are spirits when we hold fast by
love, but when He robs us of our spirit, and
re-makes us by His own spirit, then we are
enjoyment. The Spirit of God breathes us
out towards love and good works, and it
breathes us in to rest and enjoyment; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
that is eternal life, just as we breathe out
the air which is in us and breathe in fresh
air; and in that consists our mortal life and
nature. And although our spirit should be
ravished and its powers fail in enjoyment
and in blessedness, it is always renewed in
grace, in charity, and in virtues. And so
what I love is to enter into a restful enjoyment,
to go forth in good works, and to
remain always united to the Spirit of God.
Just as we open the eyes of the body, see,
and shut them again, so quickly that we
hardly notice what we have done, even so
we die in God, we live out of God, and we
remain always one with Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next we have <i>The Book of the Seven
Castles</i>, called by Laurentius Surius <i>De
Septem Custodiis, Opusculum longe piissimum</i>.
It is not without resemblance to the <i>Castle
of the Soul</i>, by Saint Teresa of Avila, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
has also seven dwellings, of which prayer
is the door. The hermit of the forest of
Soignes sends this work, with the <i>Mirror
of Eternal Salvation</i>, &#8220;To the holy Clare,
Margaret van Meerbeke, of the convent of
Brussels,&#8221; and so the counsels on which he
touches in the prologue have a slight note
of pitying sadness. For instance, he teaches
her in what way she shall go to the window
of the convent parlour, shutting out from
her eyes the face of man; and speaks of the
joy of pain and the care of the sick, with
pale counsels for the sick-ward. Then there
rise the seven spiritual castles of St. Clara,
the doors of which are closed by divine
grace, and must no more be opened to look
into the streets of the heart. Let us hear
what follows, still on the subject of love:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the loving soul cannot give itself
wholly to God, nor perfectly receive God, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
all that it receives is but a little thing as
compared with that which it lacks, and
counts as nothing in its eager emotion.
And so it is disturbed, and falls into impatience,
and into the strong passion of
love; for it can neither do without God nor
have Him, reach His depth nor His height,
follow nor forsake Him. And this is the
storm and the spiritual plague of which I
have spoken; for no tongue can describe
the many storms and agitations which arise
from the two sides of love. For love makes
a man now hot, now cold; now bold, now
timid; now joyous, now sorrowful; it brings
him fear, hope, despair, tears, complaints,
songs, praises, and such things without
number. Such are the sufferings of those
who live in the passion of love; and yet
this is the most spiritual and the most
useful life which man can live, each according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
to his own capacity. But where man&#8217;s
method fails and can reach no higher, then
God&#8217;s method begins; where man, by his
sufferings, his love, and his unsatisfied desires,
entwines himself with God and cannot be
united to Him, then the Spirit of our Lord
comes like a fierce fire which burns and consumes
and swallows up all things in itself,
so that the man forgets his inward exercises,
and forgets himself and feels just as if he
were one spirit and one love with God. Here
our senses and all our powers are silent, and
they are calmed and satisfied, for the fountain
of divine goodness and wealth has
flowed over everything, and each has received
more than he can desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next comes the third method, which we
attribute to our heavenly Father&mdash;that in
which He empties the memory of forms and
images, and lifts up our naked thought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
the ultimate source, which is Himself. There
man is fixed firmly at his beginning, which
is God, and is united to Him. And there is
given to him strength and freedom to work
inwardly and outwardly by means of all the
virtues. And he receives knowledge and
understanding in all exercises which are
according to reason. And he learns how
to receive the inward working of God and
the transformation of the divine methods,
which are above reason, even as we have
already said. And above all divine limits,
he will understand by the same boundless
intuition, the boundless essence of God,
whose being is without limitation. For one
cannot express it by words, nor by works,
nor by methods, nor signs, nor similitudes,
but it manifests itself spontaneously to the
simple intuition of pure and naked thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we may place on the road signs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
similitudes which prepare man for the sight of
the Kingdom of God, and you shall imagine
this essence like the glow of a boundless
fire, in which everything is silently consumed&mdash;a
red and motionless conflagration.
And so it is with the calm of essential love,
which is the enjoyment of God and of all
the saints, above all limitations, and above
all the works and all the practices of virtue.
This love is a wave, boundless and calmed, of
riches and joys, in which all the saints are
swallowed up with God in an unlimited
enjoyment. And this joy is wild and lonely
like a wandering, for it has neither limit,
nor road, nor path, nor rest, nor measure,
nor end, nor beginning, nor anything which
one can show or express by words. And
this is the pure blessedness of all of us, this
divine essence, and our super-essence, above
reason and without reason. If we desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
experience it, our spirit must go forth into
it, above our created essence, towards that
eternal centre in which all our lines begin
and end. And in this centre these lines
lose their name and all distinction, and are
united to this centre, and become that same
unity which the centre itself is; and nevertheless
in themselves they always remain as
converging lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, then, how we shall thus always remain
what we are in our created essence, and
yet by the ascent of our spirit we shall continually
pass into our super-essence. In it we
shall be above ourselves, below ourselves,
beyond our breadth, beyond our length, in
an eternal wandering which has no return.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall say little of the small work entitled
<i>Four Temptations</i>, which deals with
the very subtle dangers which threaten the
contemplative mind, the most formidable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
them all being quietism. With the exception
of certain discoveries in the unknown
psychology of prayer, this work, which,
as I have said, is very short, does not present
any very exceptionally lofty summit to our
souls.</p>

<p>The other little work, which is about the
same length&mdash;that is to say, about twenty
pages&mdash;is called <i>The Book of Supreme Truth</i>,
or, according to Surius, <i>Samuel</i>. He adds:&mdash;&#8220;Qui
alias de alta contemplatione dicitur,
verius autem apologice quorumdam sancti
hujus viri dictorum sublimium inscribi possit.&#8221;
But this book is so marvellous that
one would need to translate the whole.
At present I shall make no extract from it,
since we can no more divide it than we can
divide that essence whose perpetual effusion
is displayed in its unique and awful mirror.</p>

<p>I come, therefore, to <i>The Book of the Kingdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
of Lovers</i>, the strangest and most abstract
work of the sage of the Green Valley, in the
midst of which the soul stretches itself, and is
filled with terror in a spiritual void which
is doubtless normal, and which for the mind
that does not follow it is like some dark
glass bell, in which there is neither air, nor
image, nor anything that can be exactly
conceived, except uninterrupted stars in the
eternal spaces.</p>

<p>The work is founded on that verse in Wisdom,
&#8220;Justum deduxit per vias rectas et
ostendit illi regnum Dei,&#8221; and includes the
three virtues of theology and the seven
gifts of the Holy Ghost I proceed at once
to translate, and more fully than ever.</p>

<p>Let us look first at this passage on the
deserts of being:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The soul of man being made of nothing,
which God took from nowhere, man has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
followed this nothingness, which is nowhere,
and he has gone out of his ego into wanderings,
by immersion in the simple essence
of God, as in his own ultimate source; and
he has died in God. To die in God is to
be blessed; and, for each one according to
his own merits, it involves a great difference
both in grace and glory. This blessedness is
to understand God and to be understood by
God, in the joyful unity of the divine persons,
and to have flowed by this unity into the
super-essence of God. Now this unity brings
joy when we look inward, and bears fruit
in our outward life, and so the fountain of
unity flows; that is to say, the Father begets
the Son, the eternal truth, who is the image
of the Father, in which He sees Himself and
all things. This image is the life and cause
of all creatures, for in this image is everything,
according to the divine mode of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
being; and by this image all things are perfectly
made, and all things are wisely ruled
upon that model; and according to this image
everything is set apart for its own end, so far
as it is possible for God to do so; for every
creature has received the means of attaining
blessedness. But the reasonable creature is
not the image of the Father, according to
the effluence of his created mode of being,
for that effluence flows forth in as far as it
is a creature, and that is why it enjoys and
loves with measure in the light of grace or
of glory. For no one possesses the divine
nature actively according to the divine mode,
except the divine persons themselves, since
no creature can work according to an infinite
mode, for if it worked thus it would
be God and not a creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;By His own image God has made His
creatures like unto Himself in their nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and in those who have turned to Him, He
has made the likeness even greater&mdash;higher
than nature in the light of grace or of
glory, each one according to the capacity
which he has by the state of his soul or by
his merits. Now all those who feel this
inward contact, who have an enlightened
reason and the eagerness of love, and to
whom love&#8217;s infinite freedom has been
revealed, enter into joyful contemplation in
the super-essence of God. Moreover, God
is united to His essence in a joyful manner,
and contemplates that very essence which
He enjoys. According to the mode of the
enjoyment, the divine light constantly fails
in the infinite essence; but in contemplation
and in a fixed and steady gaze the vision
cannot be darkened, for we shall forever
behold that which we enjoy. Those for
whom the light constantly fails are those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
who rest in enjoyments, in the midst of those
wild solitudes where God possesses Himself
in perpetual joy; there the light grows dim
in rest and in the infinitude of the sublime
essence. There God is His own throne,
and all those who possess God in grace and
in glory in this degree are the thrones and
the tabernacles of God, and they have died
in God in an eternal rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;From this death there arises a super-essential
life&mdash;that is to say, a life of contemplation&mdash;and
here the gift of intelligence
begins. For God, who without ceasing contemplates
the very essence which He enjoys,
and who grants the impatience of love to
those whom He makes like unto Himself,
gives also rest and enjoyment to those who
are united with Him. But where there is
union of being and complete immersion,
there is no more giving or receiving. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
because He grants an enlightened reason
to those whom He makes like unto Himself,
He also gives a boundless splendour to
those who are united to Him. That
boundless splendour is the image of the
Father. We are created in this image, and
we are capable of being united to it in a
grandeur more lofty than thrones, if we only
contemplate, above our own human weakness,
the glorious face of the Father&mdash;in
other words, the sublime nature of deity.
Now this unfathomed splendour is a common
gift to all spirits who rejoice in grace and
in glory. It thus streams forth for all like
the splendour of the sun, and yet those who
receive it are not all equally enlightened.
The sun shines more clearly through glass
than through stone, more clearly through
crystal than through glass, and each precious
stone shines and shows its beauty and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
power and its colour in the light of the
sun. Even so is each man enlightened both
in grace and in glory, according as he is
capable of receiving so sublime a gift; but
he who is most enlightened in grace yet has
less than he who is least enlightened in
glory. Nevertheless the light of glory is
not an intermediary between the soul and
this unlimited splendour, but our spiritual
condition, our earthly state, and our inconstancy
disturb us, and so we have to gain
merits, which those who dwell in glory
have no need to gain.</p>

<p>&#8220;This sublime splendour is the simple
contemplation of the Father, and of all
those who behold and rejoice, and look
fixedly in one direction by means of an
incomprehensible light, each one according
as the light is bestowed upon him. For that
measureless light shines ceaselessly into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
all our thoughts; but the man who lives
here, in this earthly state, is often overwhelmed
with images, so that he does not
always actively and steadily behold the
super-essence of God by means of this light.
But in receiving this gift he virtually possesses
it, and he can contemplate whenever
he wills. Since the light by which we
contemplate is unlimited, and that which
we contemplate of an unfathomed depth,
the one can never reach the other; but this
fixed gaze of our contemplation remains
eternally turned towards the infinite, in the
joyful presence of the sublime Majesty,
where the Father, by His eternal wisdom,
gazes fixedly into the depths of His own
infinite being.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great part of this book on <i>The Kingdom
of Lovers</i> is written in singular verses. The
three-lined and breathlessly monotonous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
rhythm is rather like that of the <i>Stabat
Mater</i>, only that the third line of every
strophe reproduces the same rhyme throughout
the entire work, and rests on an abstract
idea from which the two preceding lines
rise, like twin flowers of obscurity and
restlessness. We can imagine this hollow
music floating through the spiritual dreams
of the maids of Memlinck, while their secret
senses, their faces, and their little hands
all unite in ecstasy; but unhappily a
translation cannot reproduce its taste of
darkness and of bread soaked in the night,
nor catch the image of the tear-brightened
gloom, of ice mingled with fire, of
oppression without hope, which we feel
throughout the work. I shall therefore
translate only one of these dark poems, the
subject of which is the &#8220;Gift of Intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>I should have liked to translate many other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
passages from this remarkable volume; but
I shall close with a translation of the chapter
entitled &#8220;Of the gift of sweet-savoured
wisdom&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The seventh divine gift is that of
sweet-savoured wisdom. It is granted on
the highest peak of introversion, and it
penetrates the intelligence and the will
according as they are turned towards the
absolute. This savour is without source and
without measure, and it flows from within
outwards, and drinks in the body and the
soul (in proportion to their respective capacity
for its reception) even to the inmost
sense&mdash;that is to say, even to a physical
sensation. The other senses, like sight
and hearing, take their pleasure outside, in
the marvels which God has created for
His own glory and for the needs of men.
This incomprehensible savour, above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
mind and in the vast breadth of the soul,
is without measure, and it is the Holy Spirit,
the incomprehensible love of God. In
lower regions than the spirit, sensation is
limited. But as its powers are inherent,
they overwhelm everything. Now, the eternal
Father has adorned the contemplative spirit
with joy in unity, and with active and
passive comprehension in which the self is
lost, and the spirit thus becomes the throne
and the rest of God; and the Son, the
eternal Truth, has adorned the contemplative
intelligence with His own brightness, so that
it may behold the face of joy. And now the
Holy Spirit desires to adorn the contemplative
will, and the inherent unity of its powers,
so that the soul may taste, know, and feel
how great God is. This savour is so vast
that the soul imagines that heaven, earth,
and all that is in them must dissolve and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
sink in nothingness before its unbounded
sweetness. These delights are above and
beneath, within and without, and have entirely
enveloped and saturated the kingdom
of the soul. Then the intellect beholds
the pure source from which all these delights
flow forth. This awakes the attention of
the enlightened reason. It knows well, however,
that it is incapable of knowing these
unimaginable delights, for it observes by
means of a created light, while this joy is
entirely without measure. Therefore the
reason fails in its attention; but the intellect,
which is transformed by this illimitable
splendour, beholds without ceasing the incomprehensible
joy of beatitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>It remains now to say a word about the
different translations of Ruysbroeck&#8217;s work.
Twenty years ago, Ernest Hello, who,
with Villiers de l&#8217;Isle Adam and St&eacute;phane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Mallarm&eacute;, is the greatest French mystic of
our time, published a brief volume in which
he collected under headings, chosen mostly
as his fancy dictated, various passages of
our author, translated from a Latin translation
written in the sixteenth century by
Laurentius Surius, a Carthusian monk of
Cologne. This translation of Surius, noble
and subtle in its Latinity, gives with strict
and admirable care the sense of the original;
but with its over-anxiety, its prolixity, and
its weakness, it resembles, when we contrast
with it the crude colours of the original
Flemish, some distant image seen through
sullied panes. When his author uses one
word, Surius generally employs two or
three, and even then, still dissatisfied, he
very often paraphrases once more that
which he has already translated in full.
The hermit utters cries of love so passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
that they are sometimes almost
like blasphemies; Surius is frightened as
he reads them and sets down something
different. There are times when the old
hermit looks outside himself, and in speaking
of God searches for images drawn from the
garden, the kitchen, or from the stars.
Surius does not always venture to follow
these flights, and he tries to weaken the
meaning or flatters himself that he is ennobling
it.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;He escapes me like a truant,&#8221;</p>

<p>says one of the Flemish Beguines in speaking
of Jesus, and others add:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Christ and I keep house together,</div>
<div class="verse">He is mine, I His;</div>
<div class="verse">Night and day His love outwears me;</div>
<div class="verse">He my heart hath stolen;</div>
<div class="verse">In His mouth He holds me,</div>
<div class="verse">What care have I outside!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Elsewhere God says to man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;I will be thy nourishment,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy host and thy cook.</div>
<div class="verse">My flesh was well roasted</div>
<div class="verse">On the cross for love of thee.</div>
<div class="verse">Shalt eat and drink with Me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The translator is terrified and changes
these astonishing flights into pale circumlocutions.
The wild and simple air, the vast
and savage love of the original work, most
frequently disappear in a wise, correct,
copious, and monotonous conventual phraseology;
the fidelity to the meaning remaining
all the while exact. It was fragments of
this translation which Ernest Hello translated
in his turn, or rather, he gathered
together in chapters arranged by himself,
phrases taken from different portions of the
work, and disfigured by a double translation.
He thus formed a kind of anthology, admirable
in its way, almost entirely consecutive;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
but in which, in spite of careful searching, I
have been unable to find more than three
or four passages reproduced in their entirety.</p>

<p>As for the present translation, its one
merit is its literal exactitude. I might
perhaps have been able to make it, if
not more elegant, at least more readable,
and to improve the work a little from the
point of view of theological and metaphysical
terminology. But it seemed to
me less dangerous and more loyal to confine
myself to an almost blind word-for-word
translation. I have also resisted the
inevitable temptation to introduce unfaithful
splendours, for the mind of the old monk is
constantly touching upon strange beauties,
which his discretion does not awake, and
all his paths are peopled with lovely
sleeping dreams, whose slumber his humility
does not venture to disturb.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SELECTED PASSAGES FROM &#8220;THE<br />
ADORNMENT OF THE SPIRITUAL<br />
MARRIAGE.&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">On the Kingdom of the Soul</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> who desires to obtain and to preserve
virtue will adorn, occupy, and arrange his
soul like to a kingdom. Free will is the king
of the soul. He is free by nature, and yet
more free through divine mercy. He will be
crowned with a crown named charity. This
crown and this kingdom we shall receive
from the Emperor, who is the Lord, the
Ruler and the King of kings, and we shall
possess, rule, and maintain this kingdom in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
His name. The sovereign, free will, shall
dwell in the highest town of the kingdom&mdash;that
is to say, in the strong desires of the
soul. And he will be adorned with a robe
of two parts. The right side of the robe shall
be a virtue which is called strength, so that
he may be strong and powerful to conquer
every obstacle, and to dwell at last in
heaven in the palace of the great Emperor,
bending his crowned head with love and
passionate self-surrender before the supreme
and sovereign King. This is the fitting
work of charity. Through it we receive
the crown. Through it we adorn the crown,
and through it we maintain and possess the
kingdom through all eternity. The left
side of the robe shall be a cardinal virtue,
which is called moral strength. Through
its aid shall free will, the king, put down
all immorality and fulfil all virtue, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
shall have the power to maintain his kingdom
unto death.</p>

<p>This king shall choose councillors in
his country, the wisest to be found in
the land. These will be two divine
virtues, knowledge and discretion, enlightened
by the grace of God. They
will dwell near the king, in a palace which
is called the soul&#8217;s strength of reason; but
they will be clothed and adorned with a
moral virtue which is called temperance, so
that the king may always act or refrain
from acting according to their counsels.
By knowledge we shall purge the conscience
from all its faults and adorn it with every
virtue; and by discretion we shall give and
take, do and leave undone, speak and be
silent, fast and eat, listen and reply; and in
all things we shall act according to knowledge
and discretion, clothed with their moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
virtue, which is called temperance or moderation.</p>

<p>This king, free will, shall also set up
in his kingdom a judge, who shall be
called justice, a divine virtue when it
springs from love; and it is one of the
highest moral virtues. This judge shall
dwell in the conscience, in the centre of the
kingdom, in the strongest passions. And he
will be adorned with moral virtue, which is
called prudence. For justice cannot be
perfect. This judge, justice, shall travel
through the kingdom with the power and
the force of the king, accompanied by
wisdom of counsel and by his own prudence.
He will promote and dismiss, judge and
condemn, kill and keep alive, mutilate, blind
and restore sight, lift up and put down,
organise, punish, and chastise every sin with
perfect justice, and at last destroy all vices.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The people of this kingdom&mdash;that is all
the pure of soul&mdash;shall be established on
and in the fear of God; they shall
be subject unto God in all virtues, each
according to his own capacity. He who
has thus occupied, adorned, and regulated
the kingdom of his soul, has gone forth in
love and virtue towards God, himself, and
his neighbour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Christ the Sun of the Soul</span></h3>

<p>The sun shines in the east, in the centre
of the world, on the mountains; it hastens
summer in that region, and creates good
fruits and potent wines, filling the earth
with joy. The same sun shines in the
west, at the ends of the earth; there the
country is colder, and the power of its heat
is less, yet nevertheless it produces a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
many excellent fruits; but few wines are
found there.</p>

<p>Those men who dwell in the west of their
own being, remain in the outward senses, and
by their good intentions, their virtues, and
their outward practices, through God&#8217;s grace,
they produce abundant harvests and virtues
in various ways, but they seldom taste the
wine of inward joy and of spiritual consolation.</p>

<p>The man who will feel the shining of the
Eternal Sun, which is Christ Himself, will
have clear vision, and will dwell on the
mountains of the east, concentrating all his
energies and raising his heart towards God,
free and careless as regards joy, sorrow, and
all creatures. There Christ the Sun of
Righteousness shines on the free and uplifted
heart; and these are the mountains which I
have in mind. Christ, the glorious sun and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the divine brightness, shines and illumines
and enkindles by His inward coming, and
the power of His Spirit, the free heart and
all the powers of the soul.</p>

<p>When summer draws near, and the sun
rises higher in the heavens, it draws the
moisture of the soil through the roots and
the trunk of the trees, until it reaches the
branches, and hence come foliage, flowers,
and fruits. So likewise, when Christ, the
Eternal Sun, rises in our hearts, so that the
summer reigns over their adornment of
virtues, He sends His light and His fire
into our will, and draws the heart from the
multitude of earthly things, and creates
unity and close fellowship, and makes the
heart to grow and become green through
inward love, and to bear the flowers of
loving devotion and the fruits of gratitude
and affection, and preserves these fruits in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the sorrow and humility we feel because
of our impotence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Lesson from the Bee</span></h3>

<p>Observe the wise bee and make it your
model. It dwells in a community in the
midst of its companions, and it goes forth,
not during the storm, but when the weather
is calm and still and the sun is shining;
and it flies towards all the flowers on which
it can find sweetness. It does not rest on
any flower, neither in its beauty nor in its
sweetness, but it draws from each calix
honey and wax&mdash;that is to say, the sweetness
and the substance of its brightness&mdash;and it
bears them back to the community in which
all the bees are assembled, so that the honey
and wax may profitably bear fruit.</p>

<p>The opened heart on which Christ, the
Eternal Sun, is shining, grows and flourishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
under His rays, and flows with all its inner
powers into joy and sweetnesses.</p>

<p>Now the wise man will act like the bee,
and he will fly out in order to settle with
care, intelligence, and prudence on all the
gifts and on all the sweetness which he
has experienced, and on all the good which
God has done to him; and through the rays
of the sun and his own inward observation
he will experience a multitude of consolations
and blessings. And he will not rest on any
flower of all these gifts, but, laden with
gratitude and praise, he will fly back again
toward the home in which he longs to dwell
and rest for evermore with God.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Dew of Mid-day</span></h3>

<p>Sometimes in these burning days there
falls the honey-dew of some false sweetness,
which soils the fruits or completely spoils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
them. It falls for the most part at noon, in
bright sunshine, and its great drops can
hardly be distinguished from rain. Even so
there are some men who can be caught
away from their outward senses by some
brightness which is the gift of the enemy.
And this brightness enwraps and envelops
them, and at that moment they behold images,
falsehoods, and many kinds of truths, and
voices speak to them in different ways, and
all this is seen and received with great joy.
And here there fall at times the honey-drops
of a false sweetness in which the man delights
himself. He who values it highly
receives a great quantity, and so the man is
often injured, for if he holds for true such
things as have no resemblance to truth,
because they have been shown or taught
him, he falls into error and the fruit of
virtue is lost. But those who have climbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
by the paths which I have pointed out above,
although they may indeed be tempted by
that spirit and by that brightness, will
recognise them and receive no injury.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Lesson from the Ant</span></h3>

<p>I will give a brief parable to those who
live in continual ebullitions of love, in order
that they may endure this disposition
nobly and becomingly, and may attain to
a higher virtue.</p>

<p>There is a little insect which is called
the ant; it is strong and wise, and very
tenacious of life, and it lives with its fellows
in warm and dry soils. The ant works
during summer and collects food and grain
for the winter, and it splits the grain so that
it may not become rotten or spoiled, and
may be eaten when there is nothing more
to be found. And it does not make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
strange paths, but all follow the same path,
and after waiting till the proper time they
become able to fly.</p>

<p>So should these men do; they will be
strong by waiting for the coming of Christ,
wise against the appearance and the inspiration
of the enemy. They will not choose
death, but they will prefer God&#8217;s glory
alone and the winning of fresh virtues.
They will dwell in the community of their
heart and of their powers, and will follow
the invitation and the constraint of divine
unity. They will live in rich and warm
soils, or, in other words, in the passionate
heat of love, and in great impatience. And
they will work during the summer of this
life, and will gather in for eternity the
fruits of virtue. These they will divide in
two&mdash;one part means that they will always
desire the supreme joy of eternity; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
other, that by their reason they will
always restrain themselves as much as
possible, and wait the time that God
has appointed for them, and so the fruit of
virtue shall be preserved into eternity.
They will not follow strange paths or
curious methods, but through all storms
they will follow the path of love, towards
the place whither love shall guide them.
And when the set time has come, and they
have persevered in all the virtues, they shall
be fit to behold God, and their wings shall
bear them towards His mystery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">What shall the Forsaken do?</span></h3>

<p>He shall humbly consider that he hath
nothing of his own save his misery, and
shall say with resignation and self-abandonment
the same words which were spoken
by holy Job: &#8220;The Lord gave, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name
of the Lord.&#8221; And in all things he shall
yield up his own will, saying and thinking
in his heart, &#8220;Lord, I am as willing to be
poor and without all those things of which
Thou hast deprived me, as I should be
ready to be rich, Lord, if Thy will were so,
and if in that state I might further Thy
glory. It is not my natural will which must
be done, but Thy will and the will of my
spirit. Lord, I am Thine, and I should be
Thine as gladly in hell as in heaven, if in
that way I could advance Thy glory. So
then, O Lord, fulfil in me the good pleasure
of Thy will.&#8221; Out of all sufferings and all
renunciations the man will draw for himself
an inward joy; he will resign himself into the
hands of God, and will rejoice to suffer in
promoting God&#8217;s glory. And if he perseveres
in this course, he will enjoy secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
pleasures never tasted before; for nothing
so rejoices the lover of God as to feel that
he belongs to his Beloved. And if he has
truly risen to this height in the path of
virtues, it is not necessary that he shall have
passed through the different states which we
have pointed out in previous chapters, for he
feels in himself, in work, in humble obedience,
and in patience and resignation, the
source of every virtue. This method has
therefore an everlasting certainty.</p>

<p>At this season the sun enters into the
sign of Libra, for the day and night
are equal, and light and darkness evenly
balanced. Even so for the resigned soul
Jesus Christ is in the sign of Libra;
and whether He grants sweetness or bitterness,
darkness or light, of whatever nature
His gift may be, the man retains his balance,
and all things are one to him, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
exception of sin, which has been driven out
once for all. When all consolation has
been withdrawn from these resigned ones, so
that they believe they have lost all their
virtues, and are forsaken of God and of
every creature; then, if they know how to
reap the various fruits, the corn and wine are
ripe and ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Setting of the Eternal Sun</span></h3>

<p>When the time came for Christ to gather
in and bear away to the eternal kingdom
the fruits of all the virtues that ever were
and ever shall be practised upon earth, then
the Eternal Sun began to set; for He humbled
Himself and gave up the life of His body
into the hands of His enemies. And in His
distress he was misunderstood and forsaken
by His friends, and all consolation, from
without and from within, was taken away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
from His human nature, and it was overwhelmed
with misery and pain, with scorn
and heaviness, and in it He paid all the
debt that justice claimed for sin. He
suffered these things with humble patience,
and in this resignation He fulfilled the
highest tasks of love, and so He received
and redeemed our eternal heritage. Thus
was adorned the lower part of His noble
humanity, for in it He suffered this sorrow
for our sins. And this is why He calls
Himself the Saviour of the world; this is
why He is now famous and glorified, exalted
and seated at the right hand of His Father,
where He reigns with power. And every creature
on earth, in heaven, and in hell, bends continually
the knee before His glorious name.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Nature of God</span></h3>

<p>We must consider and examine the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
sublime nature of God: how it is simplicity
and purity; height that cannot be scaled and
depth that cannot be sounded; breadth without
understanding and length without end;
awful silence and the savage wilderness; rest
of all saints in the union and in the common
joy which He shares with His saints
throughout eternity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Divine Generosity</span></h3>

<p>The incomprehensible wealth and sublimity
and the universality of the gifts which
flow forth from the divine nature awake
wonder in the heart of man, and above
all he marvels at the universal presence
of God and of His works, a presence
which is above everything, for he beholds
the inconceivable essence, which is
the common joy of God and of all the
saints. And he sees that the Divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Persons send forth one common effluence in
works, in grace, and in glory, in nature and
above nature, in all states and in all times,
in men and in the glorified saints, in heaven
and on earth, in all reasonable creatures,
and in those which are without reason or
material, according to the merits, the needs,
and the receptivity of each. And he sees
the creation of the heaven and the earth, the
sun and the moon, the four elements with
all the creatures, and the course of the
heavens, which is common to all. God, with
all His gifts, is common to all, men and
angels are a common gift, and the soul with
all its faculties....</p>

<p>When man thus considers the wealth and
the marvellous sublimity of the divine nature,
and all the manifold gifts which He grants
and offers to His creatures, amazement is
stirred up in his spirit at the sight of so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
manifold a wealth and majesty; at the sight
of the immense faithfulness of God to all
His creatures. This causes a strange joy of
spirit, and a boundless trust in God, and this
inward joy surrounds and penetrates all the
forces of the souls in the secret places of the
spirit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Christ the Lover of all Men</span></h3>

<p>Consider how Christ gave Himself to
all in perfect faithfulness. His secret and
sublime prayer flowed forth towards His
Father, and was for the common good of all
who desire salvation. Jesus Christ was all
things to all men in His love, in His teaching,
in His reproaches, in His consolations
and sweetness, in His generous gifts, in His
gracious forgiveness. His soul and His body,
His life, His death, and His service were
and are for the common good of all. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
sacrament and His gifts are for all. Christ
received neither food, nor drink, nor anything
that was needful for His body, without
thinking of the common good of all those
who shall be saved even until the last day.</p>

<p>Christ had nothing of His own, but all
was held in common, body and soul, mother
and disciples, tunic and cloak. He ate and
drank for us, He lived and toiled for us.
His toil and grief and misery were indeed
His own, but the blessings and the good
which flowed from them were the common
possession of all. And the glory of His
merits shall be the possession of all throughout
eternity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How Christ gave Himself to us in
the Sacrament</span></h3>

<p>There is a special benefit which Christ,
in the Holy Church, has left to all the good:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
namely, that supper of the great feast of
Passover, which He instituted when the time
had come for Him to leave His sorrow and
go to the Father, after He had eaten of the
paschal lamb with His disciples and the
ancient law had been fulfilled. At the end
of the meal and of the feast, He wished to
give them a special food, which He had long
desired to give. In this way He would
make an end of the ancient law and bring
in the new, and so He took bread in His
sacred hands and consecrated His sacred
body and afterwards His blood, and gave
them to all His disciples, and left them as
a common gift to all just men, for their
eternal benefit.</p>

<p>This gift and this special food rejoice and
adorn all great festivals and all banquets in
heaven and on earth. In this gift Christ
gives Himself to us in three ways: He gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
us His flesh and His blood and His bodily
life, glorified and full of joys and sorrows;
and He gives us His Spirit, with its supreme
faculties, full of glory and of gifts, of truth
and justifying power; and He gives us
His personality, with the divine light which
raises His Spirit and the spirits of all enlightened
beings into the sublime unity and
joy of God.</p>

<p>Christ desires that we shall remember
Him whenever we consecrate, offer, and
receive His body. Consider now in what
way we shall remember Him. We shall
observe and examine how Christ inclines
Himself towards us, by loving affection, by
great desires, by a tender joy and warm influence
passing into our bodily nature. For
He gives us that which He received from
our humanity, His flesh, His blood, and His
bodily nature. We shall likewise observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and examine that precious body, tortured,
furrowed, and wounded with love, because
of His faithfulness towards us. So shall we
be adorned and nourished in the lower part
of our human nature. In this sublime gift
of the Sacrament He also gives us His
Spirit full of glory, and the richer gifts of
virtues and unspeakable mercies of charity
and goodness.</p>

<p>By these we are nourished and adorned
and enlightened in the unity of our spirit
and in our higher powers, because Christ
with all His riches dwells within us.</p>

<p>In the sacrament of the altar He further
bestows upon us His sublime personality
and His incomprehensible light. Through
this we are united and given up to
the Father, and the Father receives
His elect children at the same time as
His only begotten Son, and so we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
reach our divine inheritance and our eternal
felicity.</p>

<p>If a man has diligently considered these
things, he will meet Christ in the same way
in which Christ comes to him. He will rise
to receive Christ with eager joy in his heart,
his desires, his love, and all his powers. And
it is thus that Christ Himself receives. This
joy cannot possibly be too great, for our
nature receives His nature, the glorified
humanity of Christ, full of gladness and
merit. Therefore I desire that in thus
receiving man shall, as it were, dissolve and
flow forth through his desires, his joys, and
his pleasures, for he receives the most lovely,
the most gracious, and the kindest of the
children of men, and is made one with Him.
In this union and this joy great delights
often come to men, and many mysterious
and secret marvels of divine treasures are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
manifested and revealed. When in so receiving
a man meditates on the torment and
the sufferings of this precious body of Christ
of which he is partaking, there sometimes
enters into him a devotion so loving and a
compassion so keen that he desires to be
nailed with Christ to the wood of the Cross,
and to shed his heart&#8217;s blood in honour of
Christ. And he presses into the wounds
and into the open heart of Christ his Saviour.
In such exercises revelations and great benefits
have often come to men.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Soul&#8217;s Hunger for God</span></h3>

<p>Here there begins an eternal hunger,
which shall nevermore be satisfied. It is
the yearning and the inward aspiration of
our faculty of love, and of our created spirit
towards an uncreated good. And as the
spirit desires joy, and is invited and constrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
by God to partake of it, it is always
longing to realise joy. Behold then the
beginning of an eternal aspiration and of
eternal efforts, while our impotence is likewise
eternal. These are the poorest of all
men, for they are eager and greedy, and
they can never be satisfied. Whatever they
eat or drink, they can never have enough,
for this hunger lasts continually. For a
created vessel cannot contain an uncreated
good, and hence that continual struggle of
the hungry soul, and its feebleness which is
swallowed up in God. There are here great
banquets of food and drink, which none
knoweth saving he who partakes of them;
but full satisfaction of joy is the food which
is ever lacking, and so the hunger is perpetually
renewed. Yet streams of honey
flow within reach, full of all delights, for the
spirit tastes these pleasures in every imaginable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
way, but always according to its
creaturely nature and below God, and that
is why the hunger and the impatience are
without end. If God were to grant to this
man all the gifts which are possessed by all
the saints, and everything that He has to
offer, but were to deny Himself, the open-mouthed
eagerness of his spirit would be
still hungry and unsatisfied. Emotion and
the inward contact with God are the explanation
of our hunger and our striving; for
the Spirit of God gives chase to our spirit,
and the closer the contact the greater the
hunger and the striving. This is the life of
love in its highest development, above reason
and higher than all understanding; for in such
love reason can neither give nor take away,
for our love is in touch with the divine love.
And I think that once this point is reached
there will be no more separation from God.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
The contact of God with us, so long as we
feel it, and our own loving efforts, are both
created and of the nature of the creature, and
so they may grow and increase all the days
of our life.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Labour and Rest of Love</span></h3>

<p>In one single moment and at the same
time, love labours and rests in its beloved.
And the one is strengthened by the other;
for the loftier the love, the greater is the
rest, and the greater the rest, the closer is
the love; for the one lives in the other, and
he who loves not rests not, neither does he
who rests not know aught of love. There
are, nevertheless, some righteous men who
believe that they neither love nor rest in
God. But this thought itself springs from
love, and because their desire to love is
greater than their ability, therefore it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to them that they are powerless to love.
And in this labour they taste of love and
rest, for none except the resigned, passive,
and enlightened man can understand how
one may rest and also enjoy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Christian Life</span></h3>

<p>He (the believer) is hungry and thirsty,
for he sees the food of angels and the drink
of heaven. He labours diligently in love,
for he beholds his rest. He is a pilgrim,
and he sees his fatherland. He strives in
love for the victory, for he sees his crown.
Consolation, peace, joy, beauty, and riches,
and all that the heart can desire, are shown
to the reason which is enlightened to see
God in spiritual similitudes and without
measure or limit.... Those who do not
possess, at the same time, the power of rest
and action, and are not exercised in both,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
have not received this righteousness of the
just.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Coming of the Bridegroom</span></h3>

<p>What is this eternal coming of our Bridegroom?
It is a new birth and a new illumination
which are without interruption; for the
source from which the brightness streams,
and which is itself the brightness, is living
and fertile; and so the manifestation of the
eternal light is renewed without interruption,
in the secret depths of the spirit.... And
the coming of the Bridegroom is so swift
that He is always coming, and that He
dwells within us with His unfathomable
riches, and that He returns ever anew in
person, with such new brightness that it
seems as if He had never come before. For
His coming is comprised beyond all limit of
time, in an eternal <i>Now</i>; and He is ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
received with new desires and a new delight.
Behold, the joys and the pleasures which
this Bridegroom brings with Him at His
coming are boundless and without limit, for
they are Himself. And this is why the eyes
of the spirit, by which the loving soul beholds
its Bridegroom, are opened so wide
that they will never shut again. For the
contemplation and the fixed gaze of the
spirit are eternal in the secret manifestation
of God. And the comprehension of the
spirit is so widely opened, as it waits for
the appearance of the Bridegroom, that the
spirit itself becomes vast as that which it
comprehends. And so is God beheld and
understood by God, in whom all our blessedness
is found.</p>

<b>THE KEY OF THE GRAVE.<br />

A Book for the Bereaved.</b><br />

By W. ROBERTSON NICOLL, M.A., LL.D.</p>

<p>&#8220;This volume is a collection of brief but pregnant chapters, written in
sweet, simple English which is full of consolation and drops gently into the
reader&#8217;s heart. We give the book our warm commendation and believe that
it has a mission of comfort to perform for burdened souls.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York
Independent.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Robertson Nicoll has produced a unique, exquisite, and most edifying
book. We are much impressed by the delicate and profound spiritual
insight manifested on every page of this beautiful little volume. Many a
familiar passage in the Bible shines with a new, unexpected, and immortal
light. It is difficult to know what to quote from a volume so full of delightful
and memorable passages. It is pre-eminently a book to put into the hands
of the refined, sensitive, scholarly, and devout, when they feel the awful
pressure of the greatest bereavement.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Methodist Times.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>SECOND EDITION.</i><br />

<b>MEMORANDA SACRA.</b><br />

By Professor J. RENDEL HARRIS, M.A., Fellow of<br />
Clare College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two gifts, both of the very highest, are marvellously united in Professor
Rendel Harris, and here we have the ripe fruits of one, in most delicious
flavour and most wholesome nourishment. It is not possible to review such a
book as this. Words about it do not tell us what it is. Nor will a selection
of words from it half convey its incommunicable fragrance.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Expository

<p class="center"><i>THE GENERAL GORDON EDITION.</i><br />

<b>CHRIST MYSTICAL.</b><br />

By JOSEPH HALL, D.D., Bishop of Norwich.<br />

Reprinted, with General Gordon&#8217;s marks, from the Original Copy<br />
used by him, and with an Introduction on his Theology<br />

By the Rev. H. CARRUTHERS WILSON, M.A.</p>

<p>&#8220;A book which was so highly prized by so romantic and heroic a Christian
as General Gordon is sure to awaken a widespread curiosity. This edition
is not only printed from his copy, but shows the passages which he had
marked for special consideration. The treatise itself is worthy of the place
it held in his esteem. Mr. Wilson&#8217;s introduction is entirely appropriate, and
we cannot but feel that the publishers have rendered good service by including
the work in their Devotional Library.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Baptist Magazine.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Hall&#8217;s treatise is in itself an excellent example of the best kind of
devotional literature, and it will contribute to its appreciation by the modern
reader that its sacred teachings and appeals formed part of the spiritual
nourishment of the English nineteenth-century hero and saint.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Christian

<p class="ph1">FOOTNOTE:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I shall give only one example, which is elementary in
both senses of the word. Ruysbroeck distinguishes three
kinds of life&mdash;the active life, the inward life, and the super-essential
life. The Gnostics distinguish the spirit, the soul,
and the material life, and divide men into three classes&mdash;the
pneumatic or spiritual men, psychic or soul men, and
hylic or material men. Plotinus also distinguishes between
the soul, the intellect, the reasonable soul, and the animal
nature. The Zohar distinguishes the spirit, the soul, and the
life of the senses, and in the two systems, as in Ruysbroeck,
the relation of the three principles is explained by a <i>procession</i>
which is of the nature of an <i>irradiation</i>; then the theory of
the divine meeting, God coming into us from within towards
without, we going to Him from without towards within,
etc. Cf. also the 5th Ennead, etc. etc.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
